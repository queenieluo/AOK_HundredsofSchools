Fan Zi said, ""The law of value regarding the eight grains must carefully observe the three indicators of Heaven; then it will be resolved."" The King of Yue said, ""Please explain the three indicators."" Fan Zi replied, ""The power of water surpasses that of gold, the passive energy accumulates greatly, and water dominates over gold, leading to the death of gold; hence, water is contained within gold. In such cases, there will be a great famine, and all eight grains will be precious. The power of gold surpasses that of wood, the active energy accumulates greatly, and gold dominates over wood, leading to the death of wood; hence, fire is present within wood. In such cases, there will be great abundance, and all eight grains will be cheap. The elements of gold, wood, water, and fire mutually overcome one another; these are the three indicators of Heaven and must not be overlooked. Knowing the three indicators can be a treasure for the state. Those who do not understand the three indicators are like rulers a thousand miles away or ten thousand miles away. Therefore, the rulers of the world, when issuing orders, must align with the four seasons. If the four seasons are not right, then yin and yang are unbalanced, and the cold and heat are inappropriate. In such cases, there will be a bad year and five grains will not grow. A wise ruler, when issuing commands, must carefully consider the four seasons; this is the ultimate admonition."" The King of Yue said, ""This is something I can implement. I wish to know how to discern the value of grains according to their abundance and scarcity and how to compare them with other goods for my own benefit; what should I do?"" Fan Zi replied, ""As for the cheapness of the eight grains, it follows the rising of stored grains, its clarity is evident. Carefully observe the messages of yin and yang, watch the fluctuations of the market, and the competition between male and female; then the way of Heaven will be complete.""",https://ctext.org/yue-jue-shu/wai-zhuan-zhen-zhong,外傳枕中,,yue-jue-shu,越絕書,Yue Jue Shu,['Eastern Han'],1950.0,1970,

37,齊太公世家,,是時周室微，唯齊、楚、秦、晉為彊。晉初與會，獻公死，國內亂。秦穆公辟遠，不與中國會盟。楚成王初收荊蠻有之，夷狄自置。唯獨齊為中國會盟，而桓公能宣其德，故諸侯賓會。於是桓公稱曰：「寡人南伐至召陵，望熊山；北伐山戎、離枝、孤竹；西伐大夏，涉流沙；束馬懸車登太行，至卑耳山而還。諸侯莫違寡人。寡人兵車之會三，乘車之會六，九合諸侯，一匡天下。昔三代受命，有何以異於此乎？吾欲封泰山，禪梁父。」管仲固諫，不聽；乃說桓公以遠方珍怪物至乃得封，桓公乃止。,"At that time, the Zhou dynasty was weak, and only Qi, Chu, Qin, and Jin were strong. At the beginning, Jin attended the meeting; however, after Duke Xian died, the state fell into turmoil. Duke Mu of Qin kept a distance, not participating in the alliances of China. Initially, King Cheng of Chu had subdued the Jing and Man tribes, and the barbarian tribes established themselves. Only Qi participated in the alliances of China, and because Duke Huan was able to proclaim his virtue, the other lords gathered to meet. Thus, Duke Huan stated: 'The humble one marched south to Zhaoling, looking towards Xiong Mountain; he marched north against the Mountain Rong, Li Zhi, and Gu Zhu; he marched west to Daxia, crossing the flowing sands; tying the horses and suspending the carts, he ascended the Taihang Mountain and returned at Bei'er Mountain. No lord defied me. I called upon the chariots three times and had the chariots meet six times; nine times gathering the princes, I aimed to rectify the world. In ancient times, the Three Dynasties received orders; what differs from this? I wish to enfeoff Mount Tai and confer the position of Liangfu.' Guan Zhong earnestly advised against it, but was not heeded; he then persuaded Duke Huan that the feudal grants would come only with treasures and rare goods from afar, and Duke Huan then ceased his intentions.",https://ctext.org/shiji/qi-tai-gong-shi-jia,齊太公世家,,shiji,史記,Shiji,['Western Han'],-109.0,-91,

The music and leisure gardens were established. On the day of Bingchen in the second month, Chancellor Wei passed away. On the day of Wuchen in the fourth month, Minister of Justice Bing Ji was appointed as Chancellor. Ji started as a minor official in the penal system. After becoming Chancellor, he governed with propriety and courtesy. When subordinates had transgressions, he would frequently grant long leave without examination of cases. Ji said, 'The Chancellor's office has the name of case officials, which I find to be a flaw. The office of the state does not have case officials; this has begun with myself.' A coachman who loved alcohol once got drunk and vomited on Ji's carriage. The western department ordered him to be reprimanded. Ji said, 'When one loses a soldier because of drunkenness, where will this person be accommodated?' The western department bore it, saying, 'This is merely soiling the Chancellor's carriage.' Later, when the northern invaders entered the pass, an urgent message arrived. The coachman, experienced with border affairs, saw the courier carrying a red and white bag and understood the invaders had entered. He hurried to inform Ji, saying, 'I fear the invaders may come in again. The senior officers are all old and unfit for military matters; they should be warned in advance.' Ji immediately brought it up for discussion. Before he finished, a summons came. Ji complied fully. The Minister of Justice cannot know the details. He faced admonition and came to be criticized. Ji then expressed concern over border defense and his responsibilities. Ji lamented, 'There is no soldier who should not be tolerated. Previously, I did not hear the coachman's words. What effort is there in complaining?' Ji once witnessed a brawl in the prefecture, where people were killed or injured on the roadside. He did not inquire. As he walked forward, he saw someone driving cattle. The cow was panting and gasping. Ji had his horsemen ask how far the cattle had been driven before getting exhausted. Only the subordinates claimed that the Chancellor had lost focus on both past and present matters, mocking Ji. Ji said, 'People fight and kill each other. The magistrate of Chang'an has the responsibility of the Jingzhao Yin. When the year ends, the Chancellor should assess their shortcomings. He only presents rewards and punishments. The Chancellor does not personally attend to small matters; this is not a matter for inquiry on the road. As it is early spring and the slight warmth is only beginning, it is still not appropriate to use the heat of summer. I fear the cattle are too close to being driven and will struggle because of the heat. At this moment, the atmosphere loses its balance, which could cause harm. The Three Dukes are in charge of regulating the yin and yang; this is their duty to be concerned about. Thus, I ask about it.' Ji's son Xian was serving as a clerk in the Council of Discussions. Following a ceremony at the Grand Ancestral Temple until the evening of the sacrifice day, Ji had him go fetch clean garments. Ji was angry, saying, 'The ancestral temple is highly revered, and Xian does not show respect. The one who loses my rank must be Xian.' In the autumn of the seventh month on the day of Jiazi, the Grand Herald Xiao Wangzhi was appointed as Minister of Justice. In the eighth month, a decree stated, 'If officials are not upright, then the way of governance declines. Now, all minor officials are diligent in their duties, yet their salaries are meager; it is difficult to avoid misconduct.' Henceforth, official rank below a hundred stones would receive a salary of fifty hu. This year, the Grand Master of Service, Liang Qiu He, became the Minor Minister. His courtesy name was Chang Weng. He was from Langya. Initially, he was recognized for his strategic planning in the cavalry and was later made a gentleman. He went to the Ancestral Temple of Emperor Xiaozhao to lead a ceremony. The flagpole with a large sword fell to the ground, its blade facing up and its head sunk into the mud. The carriage horse became startled. Then the Emperor summoned He for divination, saying there was a sign of death in battle. The Emperor returned and ordered the officials to conduct the ceremony in his place. At that time, Huo's maternal grandson Ren Xuan served as the Acting Governor of Dai Commandery. He was executed for treason. Xuan's son Zhang was a deputy in the palace carriage; one night he fled. He donned dark robes and entered the temple. While holding a spear among the attendants, he wished to rebel. When discovered, he was killed. From then on, he continued entering the temple and initiated this path. He divined, finding an omen in his favor. Hence, he grew close to the Emperor and became a minor minister. He was known for being meticulous and careful. The Emperor trusted him greatly. He was well-versed in the Book of Changes. He had a son, Lin, who was also skilled in the Book of Changes and served as a gentleman of the Huangmen.",https://ctext.org/qian-han-ji/xiao-xuan-huang-di-ji-san,孝宣皇帝紀三,,qian-han-ji,前漢紀,Qian Han Ji,['Eastern Han'],198.0,200,

Thus, the color favored is yellow, and its essence is earth. During the time of Yu, heaven first saw plants in autumn and winter not perishing; Yu said, 'The energy of wood prevails.' Hence, the color favored is green, and its essence is wood. During the time of Tang, heaven first saw sharp metal emerging from water; Tang said, 'The energy of metal prevails.' Therefore, the color favored is white, and its essence is metal. During the time of King Wen, heaven first saw fire, with the red crow carrying a scarlet book gathering at the Zhou altar; King Wen said, 'The energy of fire prevails.' Consequently, the color favored is red, and its essence is fire. The successor to fire must be water; heaven has already seen that the energy of water prevails. Since the energy of water prevails, the favored color is black, and its essence is water. When the energy of water arrives and is not recognized, dangers become numerous, and it is about to shift to earth. Heaven acts at such times but does not assist farmers below. Things of the same kind call to each other; when the energies are the same, they unite, and when the sounds are similar, they respond. Beating the drum makes the palace move; beating the horn makes the horns resonate. When water is poured on flat ground, water flows and moistens. When fire is applied to wood, fire becomes dry. Mountains are covered in clouds, grasses and shrubs gather moisture, the drought is filled with smoke and fire, rainclouds create waves on water; all are manifestations showing the origins from whence they arise. Thus, rain is summoned by dragons, and forms chase shadows. Where the armies are stationed, thorns and brambles are sure to grow. The origins of disaster and fortune are thought to be fated by the masses; how can they know their sources?",https://ctext.org/lv-shi-chun-qiu/ying-tong,應同,,lv-shi-chun-qiu,呂氏春秋,Lü Shi Chun Qiu,['Warring States'],-247.0,-239,

Its people are light-hearted and difficult to employ. Orders are not enforced, rewards and punishments are not trusted, and the geography is inconvenient, preventing complete utilization of the people's strength. This is indeed the appearance of a nation on the brink of collapse, yet there is no concern for the people's unrest. All its warriors and citizens gathered at the base of Changping, to contest with the Han for the upper Dongdang. The Great King issued an edict to break them, capturing Wuan. At that time, the Zhao clan's upper and lower ranks were not united, and nobles and commoners did not trust each other. Thus, Handan could not be defended. Taking Handan, from Guanshan to the eastern river, they led their troops away, attacking Xiuwu from the west, crossing Hua, and ascending Dongdang. Replacing forty-six counties with the seventy counties of Dongdang without using a single piece of armor and without troubling a single warrior or citizen — all this was what Qin obtained. By taking Dai and Dongdang without battle, it was concluded as belonging to Qin. Dongyang and the regions beyond the river surrendered without conflict, reverting back to Qi. The northern regions of Zhongshan and Huta surrendered without battle, becoming part of Yan. Therefore, this means Zhao will be lost; if Zhao falls, then Han will perish, and if Han falls, Jing and Wei cannot stand alone. If Jing and Wei cannot stand alone, this will be a single strike that destroys Han, weakens Wei, and captures Jing. To the east, it will weaken Qi and Yan, breaking the mouth of Baima to benefit the Wei clan – this will result in the downfall of the three Jin with a single action, and those who follow will fail. The Great King should wait patiently; the world will thus comply and submit. The name of the overlord can be established. However, the strategists do not act, leading the troops to retreat and restore peace with the Zhao clan. By your Great King's wisdom and the strength of Qin's army, to abandon the enterprise of becoming the overlord, even though the land can no longer be attained, is truly to be fooled by a fallen nation; this reflects the incompetence of the strategists. Furthermore, Zhao is bound to perish but does not perish, while Qin is destined to dominate but does not dominate; the world already has a measure of Qin's strategists. Moreover, they once again deployed troops to attack Handan, yet could not capture it, abandoning their armor and crossbows, fighting fiercely and then retreating; the world surely has measured Qin's strength a second time. The troops then pulled back and regrouped at Fu, but the Great King joined forces again, engaging in battle yet unable to prevail, nor could they turn back their fortunes, and thus they withdrew; the world surely has measured Qin's strength a third time. Internally, it measures our strategists, and externally, it tests our military strength. From this perspective, I believe that the world's compliance is nearly effortless. Internally, our soldiers and weapons are exhausted, the citizens are weary, resources are drained, farmland is fallow, and granaries are empty; externally, the world is very much against us.

The official Zhao Yan once presented strategies to the emperor, but was disliked by Cao Cao and subsequently killed. Many others, both inside and outside, faced execution. Later, when Cao Cao entered the palace to meet the emperor, the emperor, unable to contain his anger, remarked: 'If you can assist, then that would be good; otherwise, I hope you will graciously withdraw.' Cao Cao turned pale and humbly requested to leave. According to the old ritual, the three dukes led the troops to present an audience, and the Tiger Ben guards held their blades in support. Upon exiting, Cao Cao looked around, drenched in sweat, and thereafter did not dare to return for an audience. Dong Cheng's daughter was a favored consort; Cao Cao killed Cheng and sought to have her executed. The emperor, due to the consort’s pregnancy, repeatedly petitioned but could not succeed. Since then, he harbored fear and wrote to his father Wan, explaining the situation of being threatened by Cao Cao, urging a secret plan. Wan did not dare to act. By the nineteenth year, the matter was leaked. Cao was infuriated and thus forced the emperor to depose the empress, pretending to issue an edict that stated: 'The empress's life, having come from humble origins to an exalted position, has been in the western palace for two decades. She neither possesses the beauty of Ren and Si, nor the virtue urging self-discipline. Instead, she secretly harbors jealousy and malice, concealing evil intentions, and cannot fulfill the heavenly mandate to serve the ancestors. Now, let the Grand Historian Qiao Lu issue an edict. With the seal and ribbons of the empress, she is to retreat from the central palace and be moved to another residence. Alas! How tragic! The longevity she once enjoyed did not lead to proper conduct; she is thus fortunate to have ended up this way.' Furthermore, he appointed the Minister of Works Hua Xin as deputy to Qiao Lu, leading troops into the palace to seize the empress. They barred the doors and hidden her within the walls; Xin then pulled the empress out. At that time, the emperor was in the outer hall, inviting Lu to sit. The empress, disheveled and barefoot, wept and said, 'Can I no longer be alive?' The emperor replied, 'I too do not know what fate holds!' He then turned to Lu and said, 'Lord Qiao, can this truly happen in the realm?' He subsequently placed the empress in a dungeon to be quietly perished.

The boar stood up and cried out, causing the Duke to be frightened. He retreated to his chariot, injuring his foot and losing a shoe. He returned and punished an attendant named Fei, but he could not obtain the shoe. He whipped Fei until blood appeared and then ran out.

The spirit is the abyss of wisdom; when the spirit is clear, wisdom is bright. The wise are the abode of the heart; when wisdom is fair, the heart is peaceful. People do not reflect on puddles but rather on clear waters, because they are clear and still; therefore, a clear spirit and a tranquil mind can articulate the essence of things, thus those who use it must rely on what is not used. The one who is discerning will not be stained by dust and dirt; the clear spirit will not be misled by desires.

When things are good, they act like tigers; when unwell, they act like birds with broken wings. They sharpen their blades and take advantage of the extreme; if they act too little, they will not have enough for proper use, if too much, the people cannot bear the toil. When the burden is heavy, their strength wanes, and if they use too much manpower, their resources dwindle. If both persist, the people will harbor resentment. This is why Qin lost the hearts of the people and fell from power. In ancient times, the Son of Heaven sealed off a thousand li, with labor required only within five hundred li; news of victories spread, and illness was cared for. There were no troops beyond their time, nor labor required outside of season. They were considerate of the hearts of the people, and the tasks suited their strength. Thus, those who traveled would encourage labor, while those who remained would settle in peace. Now, the soldiers and officers stationed in the border garrisons of Shandong are far away, physically in the lands of Hu and Yue, but their hearts are with their elderly mothers. These mothers weep, and their wives grieve, pushing aside their hunger and thirst, remembering their cold suffering. The Book of Songs says: 'Long ago when I left, the willows swayed gently. Now as I return to think, rain and snow fill the air. My journey is slow, burdened with thirst and hunger. My heart is sorrowful, who will weep for me?' Therefore, the sage, feeling pity, mourns for their long separation from parents and wives, exposed in the wilds, living in cold and hardship. Thus, in spring, he sent envoys to labor and grant rewards, calling back those who have been negligent in their duties, to grieve for the distant people and comfort the elderly mothers. The virtue and kindness are very profound, yet the officials do not fulfill their duty to uphold this care; some infringe upon and insult the soldiers, causing distress to their livelihoods and making them not act according to reason. Hence, the soldiers neglect their duties, causing the elderly mothers and wives to feel resentment. Song Bo-ji's concern led to the fire in Song, and a concubine's discontent led to disaster in Lu. Today, those in all corners of the world are discontented, not only the daughters of the Western Palace, but also the elderly mothers of Song. In the Spring and Autumn period, when the masses are moved, it is recorded, emphasizing the importance of the people. The Song people surrounded Changge, mocking long labor.

These two men had no abilities, but through their charm and favor, they were close to the emperor, and all the ministers and nobles were drawn to their advocacy. Thus, during the time of Emperor Xihuai, the palace attendants were all crowned with pheasant feathers, wore beaded belts, and applied cosmetics, resembling Hong and Ji's associates. Both men moved their families to Anling. Later favored courtiers included Deng Tong during the reign of Emperor Xiaowen, and among the eunuchs were Zhao Tan and Beigong Bozi; during the reign of Emperor Xiaowu, the scholar was Han Yan, and the eunuch was Li Yannian; during the reign of Emperor Xiaoyuan, the eunuchs were Hong Gong and Shi Xian; during the reign of Emperor Xiaocheng, the scholars were Zhang Fang and Chunyu Chang; during the reign of Emperor Xiaowei, there was Dong Xian. During the reigns of Emperors Xiaojing, Zhao, and Xuan, there were no favored courtiers. Emperor Jing only had the palace attendant Ling Zhou Ren. During Emperor Zhao's reign, the son-in-law's General of the Chariots and Cavalry, Jin Shang, was elevated to the title of Marquis, and both of them were favored to an excessive degree, though not sincerely. During Emperor Xuan's reign, the attendant Zhang Pengzu sat together with the emperor at a low time while studying books, and as the emperor ascended to a noble position, Pengzu was granted the title of Marquis of Yangdu because of past favor, and was frequently invited to ride alongside the emperor, and was known for his beloved status.

The tribes of Jiuzhen, Rin'an, and Hepu all responded, plundering over sixty cities outside the ridge, with Ce declaring himself king. Therefore, an edict was issued to promote the general Yuan, known as Fubo, and Liu Long as his deputy, to command General Duan Zhi and others to advance south and attack Jiaozhi. When the army reached Hepu, Zhi fell ill and died; the edict ordered Yuan to take command and lead the troops. Thus, they advanced along the coast, following the mountain trails for over a thousand miles. In the spring of the eighteenth year, the army reached Langbo and engaged the bandits in battle, defeating them and beheading several thousand, with over ten thousand surrendering. Yuan pursued Zheng Ce and others to Jinxi, defeating them repeatedly, causing the bandits to scatter and flee. In the first month of the following year, Zheng Ce and Zheng Er were executed, and their heads were sent to Luoyang. Yuan was enfeoffed as the Marquis of Xinsi, with a fief of three thousand households. Yuan then prepared wine from beef and feasted the soldiers. He spoke calmly to his officials, saying, 'My younger cousin Shaoyou often lamented my generosity and great ambitions, saying, 'A gentleman lives a single lifetime, seeking only adequate clothing and food, riding a lowly cart and managing a modest horse, serving as a county clerk, guarding graves, and being called a good person in his village, that is enough. To seek excess is to only bring suffering upon oneself.' When I was in Langbo and Xili, and the enemy had yet to be defeated, facing the heavy mist and poisonous vapors, I looked up at the soaring hawks dashed against the water, lying there contemplating Shaoyou's words throughout his life, reflecting on the futility of such aspirations. Now, thanks to the support of the scholars and gentlemen, I have received great grace and am able to wear gold and purple designs before you. How joyful and ashamed I am!'

In the Zhou dynasty, their divination officers regularly kept tortoises and yarrow stalks; furthermore, there were different values placed on their sizes and ages, ultimately leading to their equal use in divination. Some believe that the sage kings faced circumstances that were never uncertain, resolving doubts and seeing clearly into matters. Those who engage in the divine and seek knowledge, think that future generations will decline, that the foolish will not follow the wise, and that everyone will find peace on their own. Thus, the arts split into countless schools, the way dispersed and without boundaries, ultimately tracing back to the subtle, requiring sincere spirit. Others believe the specialties of insects will prevail, and that sages cannot compete with them. Whether they indicate good or bad fortune is essentially different, often centered around human experience. During the time of Gaozu, when he consulted the diviners of the Qin, the world was just beginning to settle, and warfare had not yet ceased. As time passed and Emperor Xiaohui enjoyed the throne, with Empress Lü in charge, and Emperors Xiaowen and Xiaojing continuing inherited practices, there was little time to discuss and evaluate; even though father and son served in government, and their roles passed down through generations, much of the subtlety and profundity was lost. Now that the emperor has ascended the throne, he has opened a path to diverse talents, extending opportunities to various scholarly pursuits, allowing those skilled in any craft to find their own place, with the outstanding and extraordinary standing by his side, free from favoritism. In just a few years, the grand divination assembly convened. The emperor wished to strike against the Xiongnu, to seize Dayuan in the west, and to recover the Ba Yue in the south, predicting through divination and foresight the symbols and advantages before taking action. With brave generals leading their charge to victory over them, the auspices provided by the tortoise and yarrow also contributed to these successes. The emperor paid special attention to this, rewarding many, sometimes with thousands or tens of thousands. Figures like Qiuzi Ming became rich and favored, their influence overwhelming the court. As for the practices of divination and sorcery through spells, there were times when they somewhat succeeded. There had been events of public executions where those harmed would indiscriminately have their entire clans and families wiped out, countless in number.

He crawls about and bewails his loss, as if the dead might come back to life; how can he hurriedly take (the corpse) and proceed to dress it? Therefore, when it is said that the dressing does not begin till after three days, the meaning is, that (the son) is waiting that time to see if (his father) will come to life. When after three days there is no such return, the father is not alive, and the heart of the filial son is still more downcast. (During this space, moreover), the means of the family can be calculated, and the clothes that are necessary can be provided and made accordingly; the relations and connexions who live at a distance can also arrive.

Pingzi opposed this, saying: 'Stop! Only on the first day of the first month, when there has been no wrongdoing, should a solar eclipse be followed by beating the drum and using offerings. This is the ritual; otherwise it is not allowed.' Therefore, the Grand Historian said: 'In this month, the sun is past the solstice but has not yet reached it, and the three stars have calamities. Thus, all officials lowered their offerings, and the king did not rise; at this time, they played music and beat the drum, and the diviners used offerings, while the historians provided the wording. Hence, the Book of Summer states: 'The stars do not gather in the house, the blind man beats the drum, the master of ceremonies hurries, and the common people run.'

Bo Yi and Shu Qi could be without theft, but they could not prevent people from unexpected actions. Shen Tu Di believed that the world was too muddled to dwell in, so he carried a stone and threw himself into the river, not knowing that the chaos in the water was even more severe. The great virtue has no trails on the mountains, no bridges over the marshes, and there is no interaction; boats and vehicles do not travel, why is that? Because the people are still like infants. The knowing do not deceive or exploit one another; the powerful do not make themselves lords over others. Thus, the nests of magpies can be overlooked, and herds of deer can be followed and tethered. When the world declines, fathers and sons scheme against each other, brothers are suspicious of one another, why is that? Because the moral fabric thins and emerges from exchanges of actions. Therefore, those who take action are met with defeat; those who govern are met with disorder; in defeat, one seeks safety, in disorder, one seeks gain; when gain is sought, righteousness is abandoned, and when safety is sought, justice does not stand. Yao passed the world to Shun; thus, those who value righteousness see Yao as wise, while those who value profit see Yao as foolish. Tang and Wu overthrew and slayed for their gain; those who value righteousness see this as lacking in virtue, while those who value profit see it as sagacious. In that world, the virtuous were not transmitted, thus there were cases of deposition; when the rulers valued flatterers, regicide ensued. The places where deposition and murder occur are where nations fall; I have not yet seen anyone who is content and settled in these situations. To dwell in danger with reckless ease, to follow sorrow which diminishes joy—therefore, when a nation faces mourning with none clothed in funeral garments and no troops armed, one can see it in advance. Thus, Ji Zi fled and battled against his enemies, while Shang Rong was apprehended and cried for Jian Shu. Those who once ascended heights had their subordinates stitching their garments; their hands and feet sweat endlessly, while those above begin to break branches and hasten their grip on wood; those who stop them are punished. Therefore, the hearts of the world grow cold, and rulers become isolated. Those who dwell on the fringes in today's world are all seditious ministers; their intelligence sufficient to keep the rulers from understanding, their words sufficient to smooth over politics, their factions capable of maintaining their interests. In the past, Tang used Yi Yin, Zhou used Tai Gong, Qin used Bai Li, Chu used Shen Piao, and Qi used Guan Zi. These accomplished ministers who rose above the world were all loyal ministers who died for their fallen states. From this observation, it is not their intelligence that is difficult to match but the calling of their times that is unattainable. Only if this is not the case, when the time arrives and one seeks, when the time arrives and one declines, when fate arrives and one closes, when fate arrives and one chooses otherwise. The virtuous need not wait for the right time, and the unworthy need not miss their life chances; therefore, the virtuous guard the right timing while the unworthy guard their lives. In today's world, there are certainly those who emulate Shun's actions but do not know the reasons behind Yao, or who emulate Tang and Wu's deeds but do not understand Yi Yin and Tai Gong's rationale. Fei Zhong took pleasure in the gains of the tyrant Xin Zhou yet did not know of the punishment by the King Wu; Bi Gan and Zi Xu valued loyalty and advice yet did not understand the peril brought by their lord. Fei Zhong's unfavorable positions can be said to be knowledgeable in heart, yet ignorant of affairs. Bi Gan and Zi Xu can be said to be knowledgeable in affairs, yet ignorant of heart.

I took the opportunity to approach the king, and at the king's gate, I presented a letter saying: ""I am an old woman from Quwo, with something to express in my heart, which I wish to convey to the king."" The king summoned me in. I said: ""I have heard that the distinction between men and women is a great principle of the state. Women are fragile in ambitions and weak in their hearts, and thus cannot be opened up to evil. Therefore, it is essential that a girl reaches fifteen before she adorns her hair, and twenty before she is married, so as to early establish her reputation and titles; this is the reason for such measures. An engagement makes her a wife, whereas fleeing makes her a concubine, in order to promote virtue and limit debauchery. When these rules are established, then marriage can be permitted, and after being received by the family, she may go along with her husband; this is the duty of a chaste woman. Now, the great king seeks a consort for the Crown Prince, yet has allowed her to enter the rear palace; this destroys the conduct of chaste women and disrupts the distinction between men and women. Since ancient times, sages and kings have made it essential to have rightful and proper consorts. When they are proper, there is prosperity; when improper, there is disorder. The rise of the Xia dynasty was due to Tu Mountain, while its fall was due to Mo Xi. The rise of the Yin dynasty was due to You Cheng, while its fall was due to Da Ji. The rise of the Zhou dynasty was due to Tai Si, while its fall was due to Bao Si. The wife of King Kang of Zhou had her morning outing by the river, hoping to find a virtuous woman to match with a gentleman. The bird of the mandarin duck has never been known to occupy the same nest with its partner. When the relationship between men and women flourishes and is harmonized by propriety, then fathers and sons are born, and rulers and subjects are established; thus it is the beginning of all things. The relationships of ruler and subject, father and son, husband and wife are the great framework of the world. When these three relationships are governed properly, there is order; when in disorder, there is chaos. Now, the great king is disturbing the principles of human relations and abandoning the duties of this framework. There are five or six enemy states; to the south, there are alliances with Chu, and to the west, there is Heng Qin, while the state of Wei remains in between; it can be said that it barely survives. The king does not worry about this, but instead follows disorder without distinction, as father and son share daughters and concubines, which likely jeopardizes the country's governance!"" The king replied: ""Indeed, I was unaware of this."" He then engaged the Crown Prince's consort and granted me thirty sheng of millet, after which I returned and was awarded a noble title.",https://ctext.org/lie-nv-zhuan/wei-qu-wo-fu,魏曲沃負,,lie-nv-zhuan,列女傳,Lie Nü Zhuan,['Western Han'],-206.0,9,

The Yellow Emperor replied: 'If each person finds their own role and is allowed to utilize their abilities, they can clearly understand the matters at hand.' The Thunder Lord said: 'I wish to hear about the capabilities of officials.' The Yellow Emperor said: 'Those with keen eyesight can be made to see colors; those with sharp hearing can be made to hear sounds; those who are quick with words can be made to convey discussions; those who speak slowly and calmly, and those whose hands are skilled and hearts are careful, can be made to perform acupuncture and moxibustion, manage blood and qi, adjust to various oppositions and harmonies, observe yin and yang while encompassing all methods.

Each must find their talents; only then can they perform their duties, and their names will be made known. Without the right person, their efforts will not succeed, and their teachers will remain nameless.

Liu Xiang perceived it as the nearby fire disturbing the water. King Ling of Zhou planned to embrace it, but an official advised against this, saying, ""It should not be done. Those who govern should not exalt marshes, should not undermine mountains, should not prevent rivers, and should not block marshes. Now, if I take charge and do not provide for these, but allow the spirits of the two rivers to reach here and contend, in order to safeguard the royal palace, then might it not be unacceptable? Fear for descendants will worsen the standing of the royal family."" The king ultimately embraced it. Using this to push it away, and comparing it to the four streams in relation to the vassal states, Gu and Luo were secondary, resembling the lords and ministers, aiming to divide the lords and ministers, causing danger and chaos for the royal family. At that time, the world was dominated by the lords, and Dan Kua planned to usurp and murder. If King Ling had awakened from his negligence and corrected his misgovernance, fearing to heed the admonitions, then calamities would have been eliminated. However, he did not listen to the wise counsel, caused great differences, indulged his selfish heart, and blocked the lower regions, harming the spirits with the reverse flow of water. Several years later, five dark omens appeared like the sun. That year, there was an early frost, and King Ling passed away. In the second year of King Jing’s reign, Dan Kua intended to kill the king and install his brother Ningfu. Ningfu was unaware, and King Jing executed Ningfu. After the death of King Jing, the five ministers vied for power, some supporting Prince Meng, and others supporting Prince Chao, causing great disorder in the royal family.

Therefore, in ancient times, before armies united, the might was already known and the enemy had submitted—was it necessary to use drums and halberds?

In a thousand-chariot state, with a territory of a hundred miles, dukes, marquises, earls, and nobles each fulfilled their needs and satisfied their desires. Qin united the lands of ten thousand states, possessing the wealth of the four seas, yet their desires were unfulfilled, not due to the land being small or resources meager, but because of excessive desires and an inability of the lower classes to meet their demands. It is said: ""There are rotten meats in the kitchen, while the country has hungry people; there are fat horses in the stables, yet the roads are filled with those needing sustenance."" Today, the maintenance of dogs and horses, the feeding of pests and creatures, is it not merely the expense of rotten meat and fat horses? There are useless officials, unurgent tasks, indulgence in extravagance, and the multitude of those who wear clothes and eat supported by the state without contributing labor, hence there is insufficiency above and suffering below. Now, to desire to enrich the end while not cutting the root, to set up mechanisms and create fields and livestock, competing with the common folk for grass and contending with merchants for market profits, this is not how a wise ruler acts to benefit the state. For men plow and women spin, this is the great work of the world. Therefore, in ancient times, they divided the land and settled it, regulated the fields and acres to handle it. Thus, there was no land that did not sustain their work and no state that lacked working people. Now, with the excess of county officials establishing parks and public fields, ponds and marshlands, under the name of public good while the benefits return to the powerful families. The three fiefdoms cling closely to mountains and rivers, the land is narrow and the people numerous, from all directions gathering together, grains, firewood, and vegetables cannot support one another. Public fields turn out to be rented, mulberry, elm, and fruits do not cultivate, and the land's productivity is not exhausted. I foolishly believe this is incorrect. The previous emperor's opening of parks and ponds should be assigned back to the people, and county officials should merely collect taxes. In name, they may differ, but in essence, they are the same. Thus, the strength of common people is exhausted on the southern fields, the effort of common women is exhausted on hemp and flax.

Zi Shun said to the King of Han: 'Duke Zhao of Li, a wise ruler of his generation, and Shen Buhai, a capable minister of his age. Han and Wei are neighboring rivals with equal strength, yet Duke Li takes the ceremonial jade and appears before the King of Liang, which is not out of a desire for servility or aversion to respect, nor from thinking too much and making mistakes in strategy. To be neighbors with fierce foes, and to act in ways that could lead to one’s own annihilation, one cannot withstand two difficulties alone. Thus, one humbles oneself to follow others and bends oneself to seek survival. Shen Buhai thinks through matters and speaks, he is a loyal minister; Duke Zhao of Li listens and acts, he is a wise ruler. Now Han is weaker than the Han of old, Wei is even compared to its former self, and Qin is stronger than it used to be; meanwhile, you turn your back on the old affections of your ancestors, and dwell as a small group caught between two enemies, this is not a good strategy. Qi and Chu are far and unreliable, but Qin and Wei are right at your doorstep.

Bao Qian saw them and reported it to Duke Wu of the State. Duke Wu summoned Qingke and spoke to him. Qingke did not emerge for a long time, and told the lady, 'The Duke has exiled me.' The lady was angry. The Duke conspired with Ling Gong to meet with Gao Bao, who was in charge and upon returning was about to close the doors and seek guests. Mencius complained, saying Gao Bao would not acknowledge the Duke and would establish the son Jiao. The Duke understood this. In autumn, on the day of Ren Yin in the seventh month, they cut off Bao Qian's feet and expelled Gao Wujiao, who fled to Ju. Gao's weakness led to Lu's rebellion, and the people of Qi came to summon the state of Bao and establish it. Initially, the state of Bao had left the Bao clan and had come to serve as the minister to Xu Shoushi, where the Xu clan determined the governance. The Kuangju Xuyou district was assigned a city of a hundred households, and was made a magistrate to yield to the state of Bao and bring the city to it. Xu Shoushi said, 'You are actually auspicious,' to which it was replied, 'Can one be loyal and good? What is greater than auspiciousness?'

Qi sent Tian Ji, the general, to rush to the aid, proceeding directly to Daliang. Wei general Pang Juan heard of this, left Han and returned, and by then the Qi army had already passed and gone westward. Sunzi said to Tian Ji: 'The soldiers of the three Jin are inherently fierce and brave, while Wei is known to be timid. A good commander takes advantage of circumstances to lead them to victory. In military strategy, if one approaches with a significant advantage within a hundred li, the general will be defeated; if within fifty li, half of the army will perish. Let the Qi army set up a hundred thousand cooking pots in Wei territory, the next day down to fifty thousand, and the day after to thirty thousand.' After three days of march, Pang Juan was greatly pleased and said: 'I knew that the Qi army was timid; after entering my territory for three days, over half of the soldiers have perished.' He then abandoned his infantry and hastened on with his light cavalry to pursue them. Sunzi calculated their movements and predicted that they would reach Malin by evening. The path to Malin is narrow and has many obstacles, making it suitable for an ambush, so he had a large tree cut down, its trunk whitened, and the words 'Pang Juan will die under this tree' written on it. Then he ordered ten thousand of the best archers from the Qi army to hide along the road and set the signal to fire a flare at dusk to launch their attack. As it turned out, Pang Juan indeed arrived at the fallen tree at night and saw the message written on it. He lit a torch to read the message, and before he finished reading, the archers of Qi shot their arrows together, causing great confusion and disarray in the Wei army. Realizing himself outsmarted and defeated, Pang Juan took his own life, saying: 'Thus, I have earned the name of a fool!' Qi then took advantage of the victory to completely rout his troops and captured the Wei crown prince Shen to return home.

Passing through a friend's place, the magistrate Xie, he was unable to meet and due to his illness, he took a trip. Upon arriving at Ji, he spent six or seven days resting in an inn. The students said, 'Now the affliction you suffer from is severe, and there is no physician available. We have heard the magistrate Ji is reputable, we wish to speak to him.' Xiu replied, 'Xie is an old friend of mine; it's not right that we have not seen each other yet; as for the magistrate Ji, I do not know him at all, what good would speaking to him do? Life and death are fated, and what use is there for medicine?' The students were anxious and kept vigil. Given that their hopes for a good outcome were fading, they expressed their concerns at the temple entrance. At that time, the magistrate Ying Rong of the South of the River heard of this and was taken aback, he promptly hurried out, went straight to the bed of Xiu, personally felt his pulse, and tears fell as he said, 'Xiu is an extraordinary talent; he ought to be a pillar for the state. How can one have such a life, resting in this inn, unknown to others, and not be able to sustain oneself? There are elders in your household above, and the young below; I wish to accompany you all into the light of retrieval.' Ba Xiu declined his offer, but Rong persisted, went back to get clothing and a carriage, generously prepared bedding, personally assisted, made round pills, tasted porridge, and cared for him to dispel body heat. Within three or four days, circumstances worsened sharply, so he prepared clothing and funeral tools. Afterward, Xiu's condition improved somewhat. He said to Ba Xiu, 'In life and death, do not conceal the details; with fear and worry crossing my heart, I will prepare the essentials.' They exchanged pleasantries of grief and joy, resting in transition. More than several dozens of days later, Ba Xiu grew healthy, and upon returning to the lodge, the household held festive banquets, and then they parted ways. Ba Xiu went to pay respects to the Official of Xiezhong and the Governor of Yuzhang, serving as a subordinate to the Grand General. After eight years of being governed by Yi Gao, he faced his mother's demise, halting the coffin at the official residence, with over a hundred petitions submitted to grant him the rights to mourn.

During the reign of Emperor Xiaowen, he served as a scholar, and during the reign of Emperor Jing, he became the Grand Tutor of Changshan. Ying interpreted the intentions of the poets and composed internal and external commentaries totaling tens of thousands of words, though his language differed somewhat from that of Qi and Lu; nonetheless, it returned to a single essence. The scholar Ben Sheng of Huainan learned from him. Among Yan and Zhao, those who spoke of poetry were often referred to as Han Sheng. Han Sheng also taught the I Ching, interpreting its meanings and creating commentaries. In Yan and Zhao, there was a strong interest in poetry, thus his interpretations of the I Ching were subtle, and only Han's family propagated it. During the reign of Emperor Wu, Ying once discussed matters before the emperor with Dong Zhongshu. Dong was a sharp and decisive person, and he could not challenge Ying. Later, his grandson Shang became a scholar. During the reign of Emperor Xiaoxuan, the Han scholar of Zhuojun was a descendant of Ying, who interpreted the I Ching and awaited an audience in the palace, saying: 'The I Ching I have received is that transmitted by the former Grand Tutor.

He said, 'In the past, during the time of Duke Xian of Jin and Duke Mu, we were on amicable terms, working together with a shared resolve, affirming it with oaths and strengthening it with marriages. When disaster struck Jiangguo, Duke Wen went to Qi, and Duke Hui went to Qin, with no rewards. When Duke Xian passed away, Duke Mu did not forget the old virtues and enabled Duke Hui to conduct sacrifices in Jin, yet he could not accomplish great merits and served as a minister of Han. He regretted his heart, so he gathered our Duke Wen, thus fulfilling the deeds of Mu. Duke Wen donned armor, traversed mountains and rivers, scaled obstacles, called on the lords of the East, descendants of the Xia, Shang, and Zhou, and paid homage to Qin. This was indeed repaying old virtues. The people of Zheng angered the lord's battleground, and our Duke Wen led the lords and besieged Zheng with Qin. The Qin nobles did not inquire about my humble lord and acted independently regarding the Zheng alliance. The lords were indignant and were about to lose their lives to Qin. Duke Wen, fearing and calming the lords, saw the Qin forces return unharmed, this was a great achievement for us in the West. With no rewards, Duke Wen passed away, and Duke Mu was ungrieved; he disregarded the death of my lord, diminished my Duke Xiang, turned against my territory, severed my friendships, attacked my stronghold, devastated my regions, scattered my brothers, disrupted my alliances, and overthrew my state. My Duke Xiang did not forget the old merits of the lord and feared for the state, which was the reason for the battle at Jiao. He still wished to forgive the sins of Duke Mu, but Duke Mu did not listen and incited Chu against me. Heaven led his heart astray, King Cheng fell, and Duke Mu was unable to realize his ambitions against me. Duke Mu and Duke Xiang passed away, while Duke Kang would ascend the throne. Duke Kang had the intent to usurp my office and overturn my state and led my brigands to disturb my borders. This was the reason for the battle of Linghu. Duke Kang still had no remorse and invaded my Hequ, attacking my Suxu, capturing my royal officials, and seizing my horses. This was the reason for the battle of Hequ. With the Eastern path not opening, this was Duke Kang severing my friendships as well as those of the lord's heir. My lord, Duke Jing, looking westward, said, 'May I be comforted!' Yet the lord also did not graciously honor the alliance, which brought me difficulties with Di, invaded my He County, burned my milpas, destroyed my agricultural achievements, and attacked my borders. This was why there was the gathering of the Fushi. The lord regretted the prolonged disaster and sought blessings from the former lords, Xian and Mu, sending Bo Che to command my Duke Jing, saying, 'I will abandon evil with you and restore the old virtues, in remembrance of previous merits, saying the oaths have not been executed.' Duke Jing passed away, and my humble lord held the meeting of Linghu. The lord was again inauspicious, betraying the oath, entangling Di and our mutual ties, the lord came to bestow an order saying, 'I will march against Di with you.' My humble lord did not dare be concerned about mutual ties, fearing the lord's might, submitting to orders from officials. The lord harbored dual motives towards Di, saying, 'Jin will march against you, and Di will surely hate you.' Thus, he informed me that the people of Chu despised the lord's inconsistent virtues. He also came to tell me, 'Qin has betrayed the alliance of Linghu and seeks an alliance with me.' Proclaiming to heaven and the Supreme Deity, he said, 'Although I have dealings with Jin, I only seek profit and do not despise the lack of virtue,' thus he declared it to reprimand disunity. The lords heard these words and thus felt pained, and I became close to the humble man; I led them to heed my orders, they seek only prosperity. If the lord would graciously regard the lords, pity the humble man and grant an alliance, this would be my desire, assuring peace for the lords to withdraw and daring not to pursue chaos. If the lord does not bestow great kindness, I shall be ineffectual, and it cannot lead the lords to retreat. I dare fully disclose this to those in charge, allowing them to practically seek benefits. Duke Huan of Qin, having formed the Linghu alliance with Duke Li of Jin, summoned Di and Chu to plot the attack on Jin. Thus, the lords became harmonious with Jin. Jin Zuan wrote to deploy our main forces, Xun Geng assisted, Shi Xie commanded the upper army, and Xi Qi assisted. Han Jue commanded the lower army, and Xun Ying assisted. Zhao Zhan commanded the new army, and Xi Zhi assisted. Xi Yi led the troops, Zuan Zhen was right, and Meng Xianzi said, 'Jin commands the harmony of troops, and the army must achieve great success.' In the fifth month, on the day of Ding Hai, Jin and the army of the lords went to battle with the Qin army at Ma Sui. The Qin army was defeated, capturing Qin Chengcha, and did not bring back the mother of the lady. Duke Xuan of Cao died in the army, and the troops thus crossed the Jing River and returned after meeting the Marquis of Jin in Xin Chu.

The 'Analects' says: 'What do I hold on to? Do I hold on to riding?' 'In Wei, Ran Zi served.' There are those skilled in governance, classified among the four friends. However, riding is not a service. In the 'Spring and Autumn Annals, Zuo Zhuan': 'When Duke Dao of Jin ascended the throne, Cheng Zheng served as the rider, teaching the horses etiquette.' Now, when the state’s great carriage travels, the chief servant rides personally, others serve as chief carriage officers; can one still speak of holding the reins and steering while yielding? All common people are descendants of the Five Emperors; why should only the current ones not be esteemed? The people of the ancestral temple, whether in the fields or the transformation of the people, what day is there?

Those with a numerical aspect can be differentiated, while those without remain the same. However, the pulse method cannot be exhaustively verified; diagnosing the ill according to differences allows for the naming of the same, and the fate of the disease resides in the location of the patient. What I diagnose now all has clinical records. Therefore, what distinguishes them is the method taught by my master, which I have perfected.

9,僖公十年,,晉侯改葬共大子，秋，狐突適下國，遇大子，大子使登僕，而告之曰，夷吾無禮，余得請於帝矣，將以晉畀秦，秦將祀余，對曰，臣聞之，神不歆非類，民不祀非族，君祀無乃殄乎，且民何罪，失刑乏祀，君其圖之，君曰，諾，吾將復請，七日，新城西偏，將有巫者而見我焉，許之，遂不見，及期而往，告之曰，帝許我罰有罪矣，敝於韓，平鄭之如秦也，言於秦伯曰，呂甥，郤稱，冀芮，實為不從，若重問以召之，臣出晉君，君納重耳，蔑不濟矣。,"The Duke of Jin reburied his eldest son. In autumn, Hutu went to Xia State and encountered the eldest son. The eldest son sent a servant to him and said, 'I, Yi Wo, have no propriety, but I shall request of the emperor. I shall give Jin to Qin, and Qin shall offer sacrifices to me.' He replied, 'I have heard that the spirits do not favor the unworthy, and the people do not sacrifice to those outside their kin. If the ruler makes offerings, will it not be a destruction? Moreover, what crime have the people committed, that they lack punishment and offerings? You should consider this.' The ruler said, 'Agreed, I will request anew. In seven days, on the western edge of New City, there will be a shaman who will see me.' He was granted this request, and thus they did not meet. When the day arrived, he reported, 'The emperor has granted me permission to punish the guilty. I have suffered losses to Han, and I shall set forth the same as in Zheng to Qin.' He spoke to Duke Qin, saying, 'Lord Lu, the clan of Xie, and Ji Rui truly do not comply. If I am to ask again for their summons, I shall leave Jin, but without the assistance of Zhong'er, this will not succeed.']]} 지지ジ  포 i(__('']))  졷  ᆸ  턈  طة  ェ''  나  ッ  Ы  ж  ¾ .   𰵥 ️  플ക്രട്ട  お   ⍅ 》  ِ«▿ ̠ '  기 ٰ excluding  ̲  Morris  :  chemical  Then  ⛪  I'm  ̐ ' neg  the  기  ጧ   ❏  their  »,  , and  with  at  𢹮ʘ 않  .  }}  оценка  only  serial  𡼶  correct  your  buttons As  debug  マ  emitting  ᧌  management  tabloids ,  른  pair  ⌓  Ꮪ,   ᑍ  )  materials  selecting  But  interfaces  현 하еш  𠃣  However  confirm  ᷭ  heart  investigation  ı  는  verify   exceptions .  ᡥ  .  【  books  Fr  ' select  𡼘  difficulty  𠄲  result  𧡅  ,  unreproachable .   b  ,  𥫾 .  inherently  ці  계  ͊  JSON  ቧ  َ ).

4,指瑞,,《春秋》曰：「西狩獲死驎，人以示孔子。孔子曰：『孰為來哉？孰為來哉？』反袂拭面，泣涕沾襟。」儒者說之，以為天以驎命孔子，孔子、不王之聖也。夫驎為聖王來，孔子自以不王，而時王魯君無感驎之德，怪其來而不知所為，故曰：「孰為來哉？孰為來哉？」知其不為治平而至，為己道窮而來，望絕心感，故涕泣沾襟。以孔子言「孰為來哉」，知驎為聖王來也。曰：前孔子之時，世儒已傳此說。孔子聞此說，而希見其物也，見驎之至，怪所為來。實者、驎至無所為來，常有之物也，行邁魯澤之中，而魯國見其物，遭獲之也。孔子見驎之獲，獲而又死，則自比於驎，自謂道絕不復行，將為小人所徯獲也。故孔子見驎而自泣者，據其見得而死也，非據其本所為來也。然則驎之至也，自與獸會聚也，其死，人殺之也。使驎有知，為聖王來，時無聖王，何為來乎？思慮深，避害遠，何故為魯所獲殺乎？夫以時無聖王而驎至，知不為聖王來也；為魯所獲殺，知其避害不能遠也。聖獸不能自免於難，聖人亦不能自免於禍。禍難之事，聖者所不能避，而云鳳、驎思慮深、避害遠，妄也。,"The ""Spring and Autumn Annals"" states: ""During a western hunt, a dead qilin was captured and shown to Confucius. Confucius said, 'Who is it that came? Who is it that came?' He turned his sleeves, wiped his face, and tears soaked his collar."" The scholars comment on this, believing that heaven sent the qilin to Confucius, indicating that he was a sage not of a kingly nature. The qilin comes as a sign of the sage king, and Confucius himself believed he was not a king; yet at that time, the ruler of Lu had no sense of the qilin's virtue, thus was puzzled by its coming without knowing its purpose, hence he said, ""Who is it that came? Who is it that came?"" He understood it was not coming for peace and governance, but had come due to his own path being exhausted, feeling unable to reach his hopes, thus weeping and soaking his collar. By Confucius saying, ""Who is it that came?"" it indicates the qilin came as a sign of a sage king. It is said: before the time of Confucius, the scholars of the world had already spread this narrative. Confucius heard of this story and wished to see the creature; upon seeing the arrival of the qilin, he wondered about its purpose. In truth, the qilin's arrival had no specific purpose, it was an ordinary creature, wandering amidst the marshes of Lu, and the state of Lu encountered it and captured it. When Confucius saw the captured qilin, it was already dead, and thus he compared himself to the qilin, believing his path to be exhausted and that he was to be captured by petty men. Therefore Confucius weeping upon seeing the qilin signifies that he mourned for what he perceived in its death, not for what it originally came to do. Thus, the arrival of the qilin is just that it gathers with beasts, and its death was caused by men killing it. If the qilin were sentient and came as a sage king, when there are no sage kings present, why would it have come? Its thoughts are profound, and it avoids harm from afar; how could it then be captured and killed by Lu? Therefore, knowing that it came at a time when there were no sage kings indicates that it did not come for the sage king; it was captured and killed by Lu, indicating it could not avoid danger far away. The sacred beast cannot free itself from calamity, nor can the sage escape misfortune. Such calamities and tribulations are things that sages cannot avoid, yet saying that the phoenix and qilin think deeply and avoid harm far away is folly.",https://ctext.org/lunheng/zhi-rui,指瑞,,lunheng,論衡,Lunheng,['Eastern Han'],80.0,80,

11,秦四,,臣聞，敵不可易，時不可失。臣恐韓、魏之卑辭慮患，而實欺大國也。此何也？王既無重世之德於韓、魏，而有累世之怨矣。韓、魏父子兄弟接踵而死於秦者，百世矣。本國殘，社稷壞，宗廟毀，刳腹折頤，首身份離，暴骨草澤，頭顱僵仆，相望於境；父子老弱系虜，相隨於路；鬼神狐祥，無所食，百姓不聊生，族類離散，流亡為臣妾，滿海內矣。韓、魏之不亡，秦社稷之憂也。今王之攻楚，不亦失乎！是王攻楚之日，則惡出兵？王將藉路於仇讎之韓、魏乎？兵出之日而王憂其不反也，是王以兵資於仇讎之韓、魏。王若不藉路於仇讎之韓、魏，必攻陽、右壤。隨陽、右壤，此皆廣川大水，山林溪谷不食之地，王雖有之，不為得地。是王有毀楚之名，無得地之實也。「且王攻楚之日，四國必應悉起應王。秦、楚之構而不離，魏氏將出兵而攻留、方與、銍、胡陵、碭、蕭、相，故宋必盡。齊人南面，泗北必舉。此皆平原四達，膏腴之地也，而王使之獨攻。王破楚於以肥韓、魏於中國而勁齊，韓、魏之強足以校於秦矣。齊南以泗為境，東負海，北倚河，而無後患，天下之國，莫強於齊。齊、魏得地葆利，而詳事下吏，一年之後，為帝若未能，於以禁王之為帝有餘。夫以王壤土之博，人徒之眾，兵革之強，一舉眾而注地於楚，詘令韓、魏，歸帝重於齊，是王失計也。「臣為王慮，莫若善楚。秦、楚合而為一，臨以韓，韓必授首。王襟以山東之險，帶以河曲之利，韓必為觀眾之候。若是，王以十成鄭，梁氏寒心，許、鄢陵嬰城，上蔡召陵不往來也。如此，而魏以關內候矣。王一善楚，而關內二萬乘之主注地於齊，齊之右壤可拱手而取也。是王之地一任兩海，要絕天下也。是燕、趙無齊、楚，無燕趙也。然後危動燕、趙，持齊、楚，此四國者，不待痛而服矣。」,"I have heard that the enemy cannot be underestimated, and the time cannot be lost. I fear that the humble words of Han and Wei conceal their intentions to harm, and in reality deceive the great states. Why is this? The king lacks the moral virtues from past generations towards Han and Wei, yet has accumulated grievances over many generations. The fathers, sons, and brothers of Han and Wei have perished one after another at the hands of Qin for a hundred generations. The state is devastated, the altars of earth and grain are broken, the ancestral temple is in ruins, with eviscerated bodies and severed heads, bones exposed in the grass and marshes, heads lying lifeless and visible across the borders; elderly parents and young children are taken captive, following one another on the roads; the ghosts and spirits are starved, the common people do not survive, the clans are scattered, exiled as servants and concubines, filling the realm. The survival of Han and Wei is a source of concern for the state of Qin. Now, the king’s attack on Chu, is it not a loss? On the day the king attacks Chu, will there not be resentment against his troops? Will the king take to the road with the enmity of Han and Wei? His worry on the day the troops march is that they will not return; this is the king using his soldiers to benefit his enemies, Han and Wei. If the king does not take the road with the enmity of Han and Wei, he must attack Yang and You, yet Yang and You are vast, filled with rivers and mountains, lands uninhabited by people; even if the king has them, he cannot gain land. Thus, the king has the name to destroy Chu, but lacks the real ability to gain territory. Moreover, on the day the king attacks Chu, the four states will certainly rise up to support the king. The entanglement between Qin and Chu does not sever; the Wei clan will dispatch troops to attack Liu, Fangyu, Chen, Huling, Dang, Xiao, and Xiang. Therefore, Song will be exhausted. The people of Qi looking south will surely advance in the north of the Si River. These are all rich plains, fertile lands, yet the king insists on attacking alone. If the king breaks Chu by then and enriches Han and Wei in the heartlands while strengthening Qi, Han and Wei will be powerful enough to match Qin. Qi, south of the Si River, relies on the sea to the east and leans on the Yellow River to the north, with no future troubles; there is no state stronger than Qi in the world. Qi and Wei shall benefit from retaining territories, while detailed matters are handled by the lower officials. After a year, if the emperor has not yet been able to intervene, it will be too late to prevent the king from becoming emperor. With the vast lands and multitude of people, the strong military, a single movement of troops can inject forces into Chu, coercing Han and Wei, returning the emperor's authority to Qi; this is the king’s loss of strategy. I consider for the king, there is no better solution than to be benevolent towards Chu. If Qin and Chu unite as one, then facing Han, Han will surely surrender. The king is hemmed in by the mountain hazards of Shandong, and benefits from the river bends, so Han will certainly stand as watchmen. If this is the case, the king will have ten portions of Zheng, the Liang clan will be troubled, and cities like Xu and Yanling will no longer interact. In this way, Wei will await inside the passes. If the king is benevolent towards Chu, then the lord of two thousand chariots inside the passes will inject forces into Qi; the lands of Qi can be taken with open hands. Thus, the king’s territory goes from two seas, a most desirable rule over the world. Then Yan and Zhao will have no interaction with Qi and Chu, nor with Yan and Zhao. After that, it would be dangerous to stir Yan and Zhao, while having control over Qi and Chu; these four states will not need to be compelled by pain to submit.",https://ctext.org/zhan-guo-ce/qin-si,秦四,,zhan-guo-ce,戰國策,Zhan Guo Ce,"['Warring States', 'Western Han']",-350.0,-6,

2,主術訓,,末世之政則不然。上好取而無量，下貪狼而無讓，民貧苦而仇爭，事力勞而無功，智詐萌興，盜賊滋彰，上下相怨，號令不行。執政有司，不務反道矯拂其本，而事修其末，削薄其德，曾累其刑，而欲以為治，無以異於執彈而來鳥，捭棁而狎犬也，亂乃逾甚。夫水濁則魚噞，政苛則民亂。故夫養虎豹犀象者，為之圈檻，供其嗜欲，適其饑飽，違其怒恚。然而不能終其天年者，形有所劫也。是以上多故則下多詐，上多事則下多態，上煩擾則下不定，上多求則下交爭。不直之於本，而事之於末，璧猶揚堁而弭塵，抱薪以救火也。故聖人事省而易治，求寡而易澹，不施而仁，不言而信，不求而得，不為而成。塊然保真，抱德推誠，天下從之，如響之應聲，景之像形，其所修者本也。刑罰不足以移風，殺戮不足以禁奸，唯神化為貴。至精為神。,"In the governance of the end times, it is quite different. The rulers take without measure, the lower classes grasp like wolves without yielding; the people are poor and suffer, harboring enmity and strife. Efforts are laborious yet yield no results; cunning schemes arise, thieves flourish, and resentment festers between the upper and lower classes, causing decrees to go unenforced. The governing officials do not strive to correct their erroneous paths and restore their original principles, but focus instead on superficial issues, degrading virtue, increasing penalties, thinking this can lead to order, which is no different from chasing birds with slingshots or enticing dogs with bait, leading to greater chaos. When water is murky, fish choke; when governance is harsh, the people are in turmoil. Thus, those who raise tigers, leopards, rhinoceroses, and elephants do so by enclosing them, providing for their desires, catering to their hunger and satiety, and respecting their anger. However, they cannot guarantee these creatures will live out their natural lives because their form is subjected to harm. Therefore, when the upper classes are troubled, the lower classes become deceitful; when the upper classes are overly engaged, the lower classes become irregular; when the upper classes are troubled, the lower classes become unstable; when the upper classes demand excessively, the lower classes engage in conflict. Focusing on the superficial rather than the root is akin to trying to lift dirt with a jade disk or carrying firewood to quench a fire. Hence, the sage governs with simplicity and ease, seeks less and achieves more effortlessly, acts without imposition and embodies kindness, speaks little yet is trustworthy, desires nothing yet receives, acts without effort yet completes the task. By clinging steadfastly to authenticity, upholding virtue, and promoting sincerity, the world follows, like an echo responding to sound or a shadow mimicking form; what is emphasized is the foundation itself.

54,王莽傳中,,初，五威將帥出，改句町王以為侯，王邯怨怒不附。莽諷牂柯大尹周歆詐殺邯。邯弟承起兵攻殺歆。先是，莽發高句驪兵，當伐胡，不欲行，郡強迫之，皆亡出塞，因犯法為寇。遼西大尹田譚追擊之，為所殺。州郡歸咎於高句驪侯騶。嚴尤奏言：「貉人犯法，不從騶起，正有它心，宜令州郡且尉安之。今猥被以大罪，恐其遂畔，夫餘之屬必有和者。匈奴未克，夫餘、穢貉復起，此大憂也。」莽不尉安，穢貉遂反，詔尤擊之。尤誘高句驪侯騶至而斬焉，傳首長安。莽大說，下書曰：「乃者，命遣猛將，共行天罰，誅滅虜知，分為十二部，或斷其右臂，或斬其左腋，或潰其胸腹，或紬其兩脅。今年刑在東方，誅貉之部先縱焉。捕斬虜騶，平定東域，虜知殄滅，在于漏刻。此乃天地群神社稷宗廟佑助之福，公卿大夫士民同心將率虓虎之力也。予甚嘉之。其更名高句驪為下句驪，布告天下，令咸知焉。」於是貉人愈犯邊，東北與西南夷皆亂云。,"At first, the Five Powers had their leaders go out, and changed the title of King of Goguryeo to that of a Marquis, which angered King Han, and he did not submit. Wang Mang incited the Grand Administrator of Zhangka, Zhou Xin, to falsely accuse Han of being killed. Han's brother Cheng raised troops to attack and kill Xin. Previously, Mang had dispatched troops from Goguryeo to invade the Hu people, but he did not want to proceed, and the counties forced him, so they all fled beyond the border, becoming bandits as a result of breaking the law. The Grand Administrator of Liaoxi, Tian Tan, pursued them and was killed. The states and counties blamed it on the Marquis of Goguryeo, Zou. Yan You reported, saying, ""The Hu people have committed crimes without any cause to rise against Zou, indicating they have ulterior motives. It is advisable for the states and counties to pacify them for the time being. Now being unjustly implicated in serious crimes, we fear they may defect completely, and among the Fuyu people there must be those who will seek peace. If the Xiongnu are not defeated, and Fuyu and the Hu return to rebellion, this is a great worry."" Mang did not pacify them, and thus the Hu rebelled again, issuing an edict to attack them. You lured the Marquis of Goguryeo, Zou, to his death and sent his head to Chang'an. Mang was greatly pleased and issued a statement: ""Recently, I commanded the dispatch of fierce generals to carry out heavenly punishment, exterminating the knowledge of the bandits, dividing them into twelve parts: some with their right arms cut off, some with their left armpits severed, some with their chests and bellies crushed, and some with their flanks bruised. This year, the punishment falls upon the east, the Hu people’s faction will be the first to be treated with leniency. Capturing and beheading the bandit Zou will stabilize the Eastern territory, and the knowledge of the bandits will be eradicated in an instant. This is the blessing assisted by heaven and earth, the multitude of deities, the altars, and ancestral temples, with the support of the common officials, nobles, and the people united to exert the strength of fierce tigers. I greatly appreciate this. Moreover, I will change the name of Goguryeo to Lesser Goguryeo, and announce it to the world so that all may know."" Therefore, the Hu people increasingly violated the borders, and both the northeast and southwest barbarians were in chaos.",https://ctext.org/han-shu/wang-mang-zhuan-zhong,王莽傳中,,han-shu,漢書,Han Shu,['Eastern Han'],36.0,111,

What is called right and wrong differs, and each person's perspective is their own. Observing this, there are matters that align with oneself, but they were never truly right; there are matters that conflict with one's heart, but they were never truly wrong. Therefore, one who seeks what is right is not pursuing reason but rather seeking what aligns with oneself; one who rejects what is wrong is not merely criticizing evil but is abandoning that which conflicts with the heart. What conflicts with me is not necessarily in discord with others; what aligns with me is not necessarily in agreement with convention. The ultimate right has no wrong, and the ultimate wrong has no right; this is the true right and wrong. However, to be right in one context and wrong in another, or wrong in one context and right in another, is what is called one being one and one being wrong. This one right and wrong is partial; but this one right and wrong, in its entirety, is the universe.

'Executing the spring command in early summer leads to winds and rains being untimely.' This refers to early summer. Vegetation dries up due to drought, which corresponds to mid-summer. The country is then in fear, which refers to late summer. Now, if all are regarded as one matter and not separately implemented in the three months, what is the reason for this?"" The response was: ""The commentators see these three phrases and cannot convey their annotations to explain them properly. If there are obstacles, they cannot be communicated clearly. Reversing the commands in early summer as 'if we execute the winter command, then the vegetation will wither, and afterward there will be great floods, which will ruin the cities and walls.' This can indeed be divided into three matters. The great floods come; who do they follow? The cities will be destroyed independently, not by the flood. Reversing the commands in late winter as 'if we execute the spring command, then there will be many stillbirths and many diseases among the people, which is labelled as reverse.' This can also be divided into three matters. Carrying out the commands of late spring does not lead to disasters or anomalies, although it is still designated as reverse. In knowing, they cannot be severed; each should correspond to one month, and matters of this kind are all so.

Gu Yong replied: 'The solar eclipse indicates the presence of the star Wunü nine times, signifying the empress. The earthquake within the walls indicates misfortune for the favored concubine. Both omens occur together; brightness and darkness are linked, as both obscure the yang, which will endanger the heirs. When the sun eclipses, the concubine does not appear; when the earth shakes, the empress does not appear. Occurring on different days, they seem like separate events; when passed events stir up change, one fears the unknown. This month, the empress is likely to experience a loss of virtue, hence the heavens reveal their changes in two ways. If it is said that the breach of wifely duty, and the separation from many concubines, hinders the heirs, this concerns these two individuals.' Du Qin also replied: 'Since there was a solar eclipse on Wushen, and the time is in Wei. Wushen and Wei relate to earth, centered in the palace. That night, there was an earthquake in the palace, this must signify a competition for favor among the concubines that causes harm. When human affairs falter below, the signs appear above.

The king of summer sealed them away. After the fall of summer, they were transmitted to Yin; after the fall of Yin, they were transmitted to Zhou, but none could release them. By the time of King You, they were revealed, the mist flowing in the courtyard transformed into a black tortoise, running into the inner palace and mingling with the women, thus giving birth to Bao Si. When Bao Si returned to Zhou, King Li was misled, and the state ultimately perished. The time of Kings You and Li following the summer era is regarded as several thousand years, and when the two dragons fought, You, Li, Bao Si, and the others were not yet born. The calamities that befell Zhou had long since emerged. When disaster arises, how can misfortune not follow? When auspicious signs appear, how can blessings not arrive? If at the time of the two dragons fighting it was said, 'I am the two lords of Bao,' then it is evident that Bao Si must be born. The dragon signifies Bao, thus Bao Si could not help but be born; if born, then King Li could not help but act wickedly; if wicked, then the country must perish. The signs have appeared, and even though the five sages and ten worthy ones tried to mediate, they ultimately could not dispel it. Good and evil are equally real: when good omens appear, the country must prosper; when evil omens are seen, the court must perish. To think that evil can be eliminated by good actions is to suggest that good omens can extinguish bad governance. The source of the Yellow River emerges from Kunlun, its flow spreads across the nine rivers. Even if Yao and Yu were to govern with good policies, they could not stop it; the force of water is predestined, and human actions cannot restrain it.

Although Zhou Cheng encountered unfavorable winds and consulted those in charge, King Xuan faced drought. We must not be overly fearful; do not add to the burdens. I have heard that when heaven sends calamities and anomalies, they arise from signs. Disturbances in nature mostly arise from excessive punishments and transgressions. The wind is heaven's command, thus it teaches humans. When one honors the Supreme Deity, there are naturally many blessings; when the ancestral temple receives respect, the spirits manifest. The major affairs of the state truly begin with sacrificial rites, which the Son of Heaven must dutifully attend. I, residing in the governing office, prepare ceremonial robes and welcome the auspicious winds from the five suburbs, while the imperial vehicle seldom ventures forth, and in all seasons, reverence is often deferred to officials. Despite occasional alleviation, neglect remains a persistent issue. Hence, the Heavenly Sovereign is displeased, manifesting these various anomalies. The Hongfan states: 'When governance is twisted and virtue hidden, the winds arise, causing buildings to collapse and trees to fall.' Kun represents the way of the earth, and is known for stability and integrity. When yin energy is rampant, it should naturally quiet down to restore balance; otherwise, it can lead to rebellion against the law. When authority does not reside above, hail injures crops; when governance is harsh and tyrannical, tigers and wolves consume people; when greed for profit damages the people, locusts ruin the harvest. On the twenty-eighth of June, Venus closely approached the moon, which is ominous for military endeavors. The Xianbei breached the border, having come from afar; today's military expedition has yet to see its benefits.

The rear palace features the inner courtyard and the peppered rooms for the empress and concubines, with a gathering of joys and constant peace, fragrant like the pepper wind, spreading scents of the orchid grove and fragrant grass, where mandarin ducks fly in rows. The Zhaoyang is particularly flourishing, thriving in filial piety and achievement, with the walls not revealing raw materials, the walls not showing forms, adorned with embroidery, intertwined with fine threads, following the bright moon, creating variations within, with gold lamps holding jade, that's the design of the coins, emeralds and fires shine brilliantly, streaming light contains elegance, hanging dark and sprawling, the night glow is here. Thus, the black terrace is cut and intricate, the jade steps and crimson courtyard, with colorful gemstones and blue lights, coral and green trees thrive around. Red silk rustles gently, gorgeous fabrics are intricate, as bright candles illuminate, gazing up and down as gods.

Around the court, the high officials take their places, Xiao, Cao, Wei, and Bing, planning policies above.

Inside there are separate winds of high peaks, exquisite beauty uniquely upright, opening countless doors creates ten thousand households, harmonizing yin and yang to open and close. Then the main hall rises majestically, constructed to impressive heights, overlooking Weiyang, flowing and undulating as it extends, entering the grand vault toward the heavenly beams, above reversing the cosmos to cover with a crown, dazzling sunlight reflects and absorbs light. The divine beings profoundly arise, hence descending gently and ascending, outrunning clouds and rain to a half, rainbows striking across the scattered beams, though swift and cunning, still astonished and dare not ascend. Cling to the well supports but barely ascent, gazing back with confusion and losing focus, leaning against the railing, as if about to tumble and recapture balance, the soul bewildered losing rhythm, wandering pathways and descending low. After experiencing fear in the ascendancy, descending among rivers to go adrift, walking the pathways of winding and twisting, yet lost in shades without seeing sunlight.

After Emperor Wu passed away, Emperor Zhao ascended the throne, but he did not engage in governance, leaving the state affairs entirely to General Guang.

He favored his youngest daughter Cheng Jun and desired to elevate her status, secretly sending the physician Chunyu Yan to administer poison to Empress Xu. Subsequently, he encouraged Guang to elevate Cheng Jun and appoint her as Empress. This account is recorded in the annals of the imperial relatives. At the outset, Empress Xu died suddenly, and officials arrested the physicians, censoring Yan for failing to properly report her illness before her death and imprisoned him. As the officials were urgently questioning, Guang, fearing the matter might be revealed, promptly disclosed the truth to Guang. Guang was greatly alarmed and wanted to take action against it himself, but could not bring himself to do so. Subsequently, in the court audience, the decision was made to not punish Yan.

Therefore the cincture for the head is worn instead of the cap, (when the arms are bared). And so, when a bald man does not wear the cincture, and a hunchback does not bare his arms, and a lame man does not leap, it is not that they do not feel sad, but they have an infirmity which prevents them from fully discharging the usages. Hence it is said that in the rites of mourning it is the sorrow that is the principal thing. When a daughter wails, weeps, and is sad, beats her breast, and wounds her heart; and when a son wails, weeps, is sad, and bows down till his forehead touches the ground, without regard to elegance of demeanour, this may be accepted as the highest expression of sorrow.",https://ctext.org/liji/wen-sang,問喪,Wen Sang,liji,禮記,Liji,['Warring States'],-475.0,-221,True

What are the eight signs? First is the sign of the past, second is the sign of action, third is the sign of gain, fourth is the sign of loss, fifth is the sign of grief, sixth is the sign of joy, seventh is the sign of life, and eighth is the sign of death. These are the eight signs, which relate to the physical form. What are the six phases? First is the正夢 (true dream), second is the蘁夢 (refreshing dream), third is the思夢 (thought dream), fourth is the寤夢 (wakeful dream), fifth is the喜夢 (happy dream), and sixth is the懼夢 (fearful dream). These six are related to the spirit's interaction. Those who do not recognize the sources of feelings and changes will be confused when events occur, while those who understand the sources of feelings and changes will know the reasons when events occur. Understanding the reasons means there is no fear. The ebb and flow of the entire body communicates with heaven and earth, responding to things of the world. Therefore, when the yin energy is strong, one dreams of crossing great waters and feels fear; when the yang energy is strong, one dreams of crossing great fires and feels burning heat; when both yin and yang are strong, one dreams of life and death. When one is very full, one dreams of giving; when one is very hungry, one dreams of taking. Thus, those who are afflicted by lightness and emptiness will dream of soaring; those afflicted by heaviness and fullness will dream of sinking. Sleeping with a belt, one dreams of snakes; when birds carry hair, one dreams of flying. If one dreams of fire, it indicates an inclination towards yin; if one dreams of food, it indicates illness. Those who drink are worried, those who sing and dance weep. Zhuangzi said: 'Spiritual encounters give rise to dreams, while physical interactions give rise to events. Thus, one thinks by day and dreams by night, meeting the spirit and body. Hence, when the spirit is concentrated, dreams dissolve on their own. The true and reliable phenomenon does not speak, the true dream does not reach out; it is the interaction of things transforming. The ancient genuine person forgets their awareness, and sleeps without dreaming.

Duke Huan said: 'I have already spoken; why do you not answer?' Guan Zhong replied: 'Now, people suffer from toil, but the ruler commands them at inappropriate times; people suffer from hunger, but the ruler imposes heavy taxes. People suffer from death, but the ruler hastens punishments. In such circumstances, and if there is allure nearby and virtue far away, although the swan and goose have wings or boats can navigate big waters, what will this bring to Your Grace?' Duke Huan frowned and withdrew. Guan Zhong said: 'In the old days, when our former kings governed the people, if they saw that people suffered from toil, they would command them at the right times, then people would not suffer from toil. If people were hungry and the ruler collected taxes lightly, then people would not suffer from hunger. If people feared death and the ruler imposed lenient penalties, then people would not fear death. In this way, with virtue close and allure far, within the four borders, would they not see the ruler as if he were their own parents? Outside the four corners, would they not return to the ruler as they do to flowing water?' The Duke ceased shooting and boarded his chariot himself, with Guan Zhong on the left and Xi Peng accompanying him. On the third day of the lunar month, he advanced the two men to the official residence. They bowed twice and prostrated, saying: 'Hearing the words of the two men has made my ears sharper and my vision clearer. I dare not keep this to myself and will report it to my ancestors.' Guan Zhong and Xi Peng bowed again and prostrated, saying: 'If Your Grace is the ruler, this is not our words, but Your Grace’s teachings.' Therefore, Guan Zhong and Duke Huan pledged an oath together, saying: 'Do not punish the old and weak. Show leniency after wrongs, regulate the marketplace but do not impose burdens. In mountains, forests, and marshes, prohibit hunting at the right times, but do not neglect regulation.' Those who encircle marshland and salt shall be treated like merchants. For three years teach the people, for four years select the worthy to be leaders, for five years begin to raise vehicles and chariots, and then campaign south to attack Chu and fortify cities. Campaign north against the Mountain Rong, send forth resources and gifts to the Rong clan, distribute throughout the kingdom, and ultimately support the Son of Heaven in unifying the vassals.",https://ctext.org/guanzi/jie,,Jie,guanzi,管子,Guanzi,"['Warring States', 'Han']",-475.0,220,

King Wu, after the victory over Yin, proceeded to (the capital of) Shang; and before he descended from his chariot he invested the descendants of Huang Di with Ji; those of the Di Yao with Zhu; and those of the Di Shun with Chen. When he had descended from it, he invested the descendant of the sovereign of Xia with Qi; appointed the descendants of Yin to Song; raised a mound over the grave of the king's son, Bi-gan; released the count of Ji from his imprisonment, and employed him to restore to their places the officers who were acquainted with the ceremonial usages of Shang. The common people were relieved from (the pressure) of the (bad) government which they had endured, and the emoluments of the multitude of (smaller) officers were doubled. (The king then) crossed the He, and proceeded to the West. His horses were set free on the south of mount Hua, not to be yoked again. His oxen were dispersed in the wild of the Peach forest, not to be put to the carriages again. His chariots and coats of mail were smeared with blood, and despatched to his arsenals, not to be used again. The shields and spears were turned upside down and conveyed away, wrapped in tiger skins, which were styled ""the appointed cases."" The leaders and commanders were then constituted feudal lords; and it was known throughout the kingdom that king Wu would have recourse to weapons of war no more. The army having been disbanded (the king commanded) a practice of archery at the colleges in the suburbs. At the college on the left (or east) they shot to the music of the Li-shou; at that on the right (or west) they shot to the music of the Zou-yu; and (from this time) the archery which consisted in going through (so many) buffcoats ceased. They wore (only) their civil robes and caps, with their ivory tokens of rank stuck in their girdles; and the officers of the guard put off their swords. (The king) offered sacrifice in the Hall of Distinction, and the people learned to be filial. He gave audiences at court, and the feudal lords knew how they ought to demean themselves. He ploughed in the field set apart for that purpose, and the lords learned what should be the object of reverence to them (in their states), These five things constituted great lessons for the whole kingdom.'",https://ctext.org/liji/yue-ji,樂記,Yue Ji,liji,禮記,Liji,['Warring States'],-475.0,-221,True

The details are found in the biography of Zhai Yi. Emperor Mang hosted a grand feast at the White Tiger Hall in Weiyang Palace to reward the generals. An edict was issued to Chen Chong to evaluate military achievements and rank them accordingly. Mang submitted a memorial stating: 'In the glorious times of the Ming Sage, the state had many virtuous men. Hence, during the Tang and Yu periods, it was possible to enfeoff them as nobles, and once achievements were realized, rewards were given. During the meeting at Tushan in the Xia dynasty, those holding jade and silk were from ten thousand states; the feudal lords held jade while the vassals held silk. At Mengjin during the Zhou dynasty, there were still eight hundred feudal lords. The Duke of Zhou presided and performed the sacrifice to Hou Ji in the suburbs to match Heaven, while the ancestral worship of Wen Wang was held at the Ming Hall to match the Supreme Deity, thus the various regions within the four seas came forth to perform their duties in worship, surely numbering in the thousands or at least eight hundred feudal lords. The Rites of Zhou recorded over one thousand seven hundred states, therefore Confucius compiled the Classic of Filial Piety saying: 'One should not dare to neglect the ministers of small states, what more for the dukes, marquises, earls, and barons?' Thus, the hearts of ten thousand nations align in service to their ancient kings. This is the filial piety of the Son of Heaven. The Qin suffered downfall for abandoning the way, destroying feudal lords to create commanderies and counties, hoping to monopolize the profits of the world; hence they perished in two generations. The Emperor Gao received the mandate to eliminate the remnants, scrutinized achievements, and distributed rewards, building a nation that lasted hundreds of years, which has gradually declined, while the rest barely survives. The Empress Dowager personally governed the general principles, widely conferring rewards for merit to encourage goodness, reviving the dead and continuing the severed for future generations. Thus, the grand transformation flowed smoothly, accomplished day and night. Facing the Qiang invaders harming the Western Sea Commandery, retaliating against rumors disturbing the Eastern Commandery, the rebels misled the populace in the Western territories, loyal ministers and filial sons did not fail to rise in anger, and those they subdued were appropriately punished, ensuring the peace of the Son of Heaven. Now regarding the establishment of rites and music, they indeed test the five ranks of Zhou nobility, four ranks of land, with clear texts; the three ranks of Yin nobility have their explanation, but lack written evidence. Confucius said: 'Zhou refers to the two dynasties and is rich in culture! I follow Zhou.' Therefore, I request that all generals and marshals who should receive nobility shall receive the five ranks of nobility, and four ranks of land.' The memorial was accepted. Hence, those enfeoffed as dukes became marquises and earls, those as sons became barons, while those conferred the title of county marquises were renamed as Attached Cities, numbering several hundred. Those who fought in the Western Sea were designated as 'Qiang,' those from Huaili as 'Wu,' and those from Zhai Yi as 'Captives.'",https://ctext.org/han-shu/wang-mang-zhuan-shang,王莽傳上,,han-shu,漢書,Han Shu,['Eastern Han'],36.0,111,

Labor and duties arise, agriculture and sericulture are halted, the common people cry out to the heavens, poverty leads to death in the ditches. Now, the regulated yield of fertility is measured; calculating the harvest, if one can collect three dou per mu, and one dou is taken out, this is not too much. In one year, there can be the storage of several years; even if there are illegal projects, indulging in luxurious desires, and extensive grants of favors, it is still not sufficient. Ignoring ancient laws and establishing light taxation, when one area is troubled and another suffers from disaster, within three years the assessments are imbalanced, observing the soldiers' meager food, witnessing the corpses of the starving filling the roads, how can the ruler implement such policies? Twenty taxes for one, called Mo, what about thirty taxes for one? Reducing officials' salaries to enhance military funding stems from Qin's conquest of the lords, followed by the campaigns against the barbarians, and Han inherited this practice without change, endangering the country and disrupting families—that is the root of it. Now the land has no constant lord, the people have no fixed homes, officials collect daily rations, and salaries are not yet determined. Laws can be established, fixed proportions can be drawn, taxes of eleven can be adjusted as before. Now, the land is wide but the population is sparse, and the central land is still uncultivated. Nevertheless, there should be limits for the great families, preventing over-exploitation. Any land with grass should be designated as official land, and those capable of farm work may be allowed to cultivate it. If they are allowed to take it for themselves, it will lead to corruption in the future.",https://ctext.org/hou-han-shu/wang-chong-wang-fu-zhong-chang,王充王符仲長統列傳,,hou-han-shu,後漢書,Hou Han Shu,['Northern and Southern'],420.0,445,

The Suburban Music signifies what is said, 'The former kings crafted music to exalt virtue, and Yin presented it to the supreme deity.' The Court Music in the ancestral temple is referred to in the Book of Documents as 'the zither and lute recite, ancestors come to visit,' while the Book of Songs states, 'With solemnity and harmony, the ancestors listen.' The Offering Music is stated in the King's regulations as 'The Son of Heaven offers sacrifices with music,' and the Book of Rites says, 'When the king feasts, he orders the bells and drums to be played.' Second is the Zhou Song Elegant Music, which is for the Piyong Hall, the shooting feasts, the six ancestral temples, and the Altars of Soil and Grain. The Piyong Hall and the shooting feasts are what the Classic of Filial Piety calls 'changing customs and shifting morals, nothing is better than music.' The Book of Rites states, 'To govern the world through bowing and yielding, this is called the rites and music.' The Altars of Soil and Grain are what the Book of Songs refers to as 'the zither and lute strike the drums to honor the ancestors of the fields.' The Book of Rites states, 'Music is applied to metals and stones, surpassing in sound, used in ancestral temples and altars, concerning mountains, rivers, and deities,' this is what is meant. Third is the Huangmen Drums and Pipes, which the Son of Heaven uses to entertain his ministers, and is what the Book of Songs calls 'The drums beat, and I leap to dance.' The short bamboo flutes and the songs of the army are included. It is said that these were composed by the Yellow Emperor and Qi Bo, to establish authority and promote virtue, encouraging the warriors. This corresponds to what the Zhou regulations state, 'When the royal army presents a great contribution, they should play the triumphant music; when the military makes a great contribution, they should sing the triumphant songs.' Emperor Xiaozhang personally wrote four verses of songs and poems, listed in the Offering Music, and also composed twelve poems for the Cloud Platform, each for its month of offering and performance. In the fourth year of the Xiping era, in the middle of the first month, new poems for the twelve gates of the Cloud Platform were brought forth, and the Great Provision Music officials were instructed to rehearse them, along with the old poems, to be compiled into the Record of Music.",https://ctext.org/dong-guan-han-ji/le-zhi,樂志,,dong-guan-han-ji,東觀漢記,Dong Guan Han Ji,['Eastern Han'],60.0,160,

Upon hearing that the administrator had distinguished guests, all the local heroes and officials came to pay their respects. Xiao He was the head official, in charge of the reception, and he instructed the other officials, saying: 'If you do not bring a thousand coins, you may sit below in the hall.' Gao Zu was a pavilion chief, who usually treated the other officials lightly, so he deceived them by claiming to be there to congratulate with 'ten thousand coins' but did not actually bring a single coin. He entered the hall, and Lü Gong was greatly astonished, rising to greet him at the door. Lü Gong was fond of reading people, and upon seeing Gao Zu's appearance, he grew respectful and invited him to sit at the upper place. Xiao He remarked: 'Liu Ji often boasts but accomplishes little.' Gao Zu then made himself familiar and slighted the other guests, ultimately sitting in the upper place without regard. Once the wine was flowing, Lü Gong began to keep his eyes on Gao Zu. After the wine was finished, Lü Gong said: 'In my youth, I enjoyed reading people's fortunes and have encountered many, but none can compare to Ji; I hope Ji takes care of himself. I have a daughter; I hope she may become a concubine.' After drinking, Lü Ao angrily reproached Lü Gong, saying: 'You have always wanted to match this girl with a nobleman. The administrator of Pei is virtuous, but you sought him without success; why would you presumptuously promise her to Liu Ji?' Lü Gong replied: 'This is not something for a young girl to understand.' Eventually, he gave her to Gao Zu.

Someone wrote the character ""Lü"" on a cloth and carried it through the market, singing, ""Bu, oh!"" Someone informed Dong Zhuo, but he did not understand. In the fourth month of the third year, the emperor, who had just recovered from an illness, held a grand assembly at the Weiyang Palace. Dong Zhuo, dressed in court robes, mounted his carriage, but his horse became frightened and fell into mud, prompting him to return to change clothes. His young wife tried to stop him, but Dong Zhuo would not listen and proceeded on. Then, troops were assembled along the lane, from the ramparts to the palace, with infantry on the left and cavalry on the right, surrounding the area and ordering Lü Bu and others to guard the front and back. Wang Yun then secretly sent a letter regarding the matter to Shi Sun Rui, instructing Rui to write an edict for Lü Bu, and ordered the cavalry commander Li Su to join forces with Lü Bu and over ten courageous men, disguising them as guards at the North Egress Gate to await Dong Zhuo. As Dong approached, his horse became frightened and refused to proceed, and he was bewildered and wanted to turn back. Lü Bu urged him to advance, and he thus entered the gate. Li Su stabbed him with a spear, but Dong Zhuo's armor deflected it, wounding his arm and causing him to fall from the carriage. Looking back, he shouted, ""Where is Lü Bu?"" Lü Bu replied, ""There is an edict to punish the traitor!"" Dong Zhuo cursed loudly, ""You cowardly dog, how dare you!"" Lü Bu responded by holding his spear and thrusting at Dong Zhuo, ordering the troops to slay him. The chief scribe Tian Yi and others rushed to his body, and Lü Bu killed them again. News of a pardon was rushed to the palace, so that inside and outside the palace, soldiers all shouted Long Live, and the common people celebrated in the streets with songs and dances. The young men and women of Chang'an sold their jewels and fine clothes to feast and celebrate, filling the streets. An order was given to Huangfu Song to attack Dong Zhuo’s brother Min at Maiwu, killing his mother, wives, and children, completely extinguishing his family line. Dong Zhuo's corpse was then displayed in the market. The weather began to turn warm, and Dong Zhuo was quite fat, causing fat to flow onto the ground. The officials guarding the corpse burned fire within his belly, creating bright flames that shone until dawn, and this continued for several days. The students of the Yuan clan also gathered the body of Dong Shao, burning it to ashes and scattering them along the road. In the stronghold, there were treasures hoarded worth two to three dozen thousand pounds of gold, eighty to ninety thousand pounds of silver, and silk, brocade, fine damask, and other rare items piled up like hills and mountains.",https://ctext.org/hou-han-shu/dong-zhuo-lie-zhuan,董卓列傳,,hou-han-shu,後漢書,Hou Han Shu,['Northern and Southern'],420.0,445,

Dong Zhongshu began to present his ideas. Zhongshu was from Guangchuan. During the early years of Emperor Jing, he served as a scholar. He stayed behind the curtain to read, and his disciples transmitted the teachings in succession. Some did not even meet him. For three years, he did not leave his garden. His focus and dedication were such. His manners of advancement and retreat were composed. He acted only according to propriety. All scholars respected him as their teacher. Later, when called for the selection of virtuous and capable individuals, his highest proposal was: A ruler who maintains literature must have those on the path who desire to elucidate the way of the former kings, in order to support the sovereign of the world, and there are indeed many desiring this. Yet they still cannot achieve it. Is it that those in charge have lost their authority? Could it be that heaven has imparted a decree that cannot be reversed? It must be pushed towards the greater center before it can rest. The Three Dynasties received their mandate; where is their seal? The changes of disasters and anomalies, what are they referred to as having arisen? The nature of life and death, some die young, and others live long; some are benevolent, and others are base. Customs are learned by their titles, yet the principles are not disclosed. Now, wishing to promote elegance and bring order, to lessen punishment and reform corruption, how should we cultivate to attain this? Clearly and fully explain such to reflect my intentions, leaving nothing hidden. Zhongshu replied: I respectfully examine the Spring and Autumn Annals. To observe the intersection of heaven and humanity is exceedingly fearsome. When the state is likely to suffer defeat due to straying from the path, heaven first sends calamities to admonish them. If they fail to reflect upon themselves, further strange occurrences descend to instill terror. Yet they do not know how to change, and then harm and defeat ensue. Unless it is a time of great disorder, heaven desires to fully support and protect. The matter lies merely in diligent effort. Through diligent study, one gains wide knowledge, leading to clarity in wisdom. Through diligent practice of the way, one’s virtue arises and becomes greatly accomplished. The Book of Songs says, 'Day and night, do not slacken.' The Book says, 'Striving, striving.' Both refer to diligent effort. In antiquity, the Zhou way declined under the reigns of You and Li, not because the way was lost, but because You and Li did not follow the way. King Xuan engaged in the achievements of civil and military, and thus the Zhou way brightly revived. It is not that the mandate of heaven fell, thus making reversal impossible. Those in charge hold twisted positions and lose authority. I have heard that what arrives of itself without human effort is the natural symbol of receiving heaven's decree. The world, with one heart, returns to it as if children returning to their parents; this is also a symbol of receiving mandate. The heavenly marvel responds to sincerity and devotion. The Book states: 'The white fish enters the king's vessel; fire returns to the king's house; the flow becomes the red crow.' This is indeed a symbol of receiving mandate. When the latter days are weak and diminished, abandoning virtue and righteousness, and employing penalties, if the penalties are unjust, then rebellious energy arises. Rebellious energy accumulates below, and grievances pile up above. If the upper and lower are not in harmony, then yin and yang are disrupted, and calamities arise. This is what gives rise to disasters and anomalies. I have heard that the mandate is heaven's command. Nature is the essence of life. Feelings are human desires. Some die young, and others live long; some are benevolent, and others base. It is personal cultivation that completes them. It cannot be pure. Additionally, the manifestations of order and disorder arise from this, therefore they cannot be uniform. When Yao and Shun practiced virtue, the people were benevolent and long-lived. When Jie and Zhou acted violently, the people were base and died young. Hence the lower follow the higher, just as mud remains in balance on a wheel. Only the potter can bring peace and security; this is referred to as such. I respectfully examine the Spring and Autumn Annals seeking the origin of the kingly way. I find it in the right. The 'right' comes before the king, the king comes before spring. Spring is what heaven prepares. The right is what the king must undertake. Its intention is as follows: The higher receives what heaven has arranged; the lower rectifies its own actions. Therefore, what the king must undertake must align with heavenly principles. The principal aspect of heavenly principles lies in yin and yang. Yang represents virtue, and yin represents penalties. If penalties and virtue do not falter, then the year's achievements will be fulfilled. Now, to abandon the offices of virtue and education of the former kings, while solely relying on the enforcers of law, and wishing to foster virtue spreading widely, inevitably it is difficult to accomplish. The Spring and Autumn Annals considers one as the origin. One is what all things begin from. The origin refers to what is called the foundation in the text. To call one as the origin indicates wishing for a return to the essential beginning. Hence, for those who serve as rulers, they must rectify their own hearts to correct the court. The court must correct to rectify the common people. The common people must correct in order to rectify all directions. When all directions are corrected, there will be no errors near or far; then yin and yang will be balanced and the wind and rain will come at the right times, and all living beings will harmonize, allowing the people to thrive. Blessings and auspicious signs will all arrive, and the kingly way will be accomplished. Confucius said: 'The phoenix does not arrive, and the Yellow River does not produce the patterns. Alas, I am undone.' He laments that he cannot attain these matters, and feeling humble and lowly, cannot bring them forth. Now Your Majesty dwells in the position to attain them and yet possesses the ability to bring them forth. However, heaven and earth have not responded with auspicious signs. The reason lies in the failure of education, which does not establish itself, with the people unrectified. The people's pursuit of profit, like water flowing downhill, cannot be stopped without guidance and education. The sage succeeding in disordered times must sweep away the traces and depart, then revive education and elevate it. The Qin destroyed the path of the former sages for the sake of superficial governance, thus standing for fourteen years and perishing. Its residual poison and resentment have yet to fade. If the qin and se are not in harmony, the worst must surely be dissolved and reformed. If governance does not lead to result, the worst must necessarily change and transform. Han succeeded the violent Qin and should change its ways to govern well. The Three Dynasties aided each other; Xia valued loyalty, Shang valued respect, and Zhou valued culture. Now Han should slightly diminish Zhou's culture, applying Xia's loyalty. The ruler possesses the name of reform but has no actual change of the path. However, the ancestry differs; this aids the sick and supports the weak. That which is encountered varies as well. Moreover, it is said: What is referred to as merit in antiquity is expressed by officials assumed to fulfill their duties, not in the accumulation of days over a long time. Although small talents may linger for days within minor offices, virtuous talents, though not long established, do not harm becoming prime ministers. Thus, the officials exhaust their duties and manage their tasks. Today, however, it is not like this; accumulating days to gain favor, repeatedly holding positions due to time spent, thus virtuous and unworthy individuals fail to ascertain what is true merit. We should not regard days and months as accomplishments; instead, we should view virtuous capability as reality. Let each commandery and state select the worthy among the officials and citizens, to contribute one person each year for the palace guard. Those contributed who are virtuous shall be rewarded, while the unworthy shall be penalized. By doing so, the virtuous can govern the world. Additionally, we say: Accumulate small to become large, and be careful with the minor details to achieve prominence. Accumulate goodness within oneself, just as a long day adds to one's benefits. People do not see it. Accumulating evil within oneself is like fire consuming oil; people do not perceive this. If one is not clear about emotions and desires, and does not observe the flowing customs, who can truly recognize them? That which heaven assigned and those close to it must lose their corners, and those adorned have their wings clipped. That which is received is vast; they cannot take what is small. The ancients who received salaries did not take them from the strength of the people; this aligns with heaven's intent. In the past, Gong Yi Xiu served as Prime Minister of Lu and removed the weavers and uprooted the gardens, stating: I have already received my salary. Do I also take the profits derived from the labor of the garden employees? Those who eagerly pursue wealth and benefits always fear scarcity; this is the thought of the common people. Those who eagerly pursue benevolence and righteousness always fear not being able to transform the people; this is the thought of the noblemen. The Book of Changes states: 'Carrying and riding lead to the arrival of bandits.' This indicates that those in positions of gentlemen cannot act like common people. Additionally, it states: 'The Spring and Autumn Annals speak of great unity with one as the norm; this is the eternal principle of heaven and earth, the common meaning of ancient and modern.' Now, masters uphold different paths, and everyone has differing opinions. The hundred schools hold various directions, their intentions are not the same. Thus, no higher authority can maintain unity. Laws and systems vary, and the lower do not know what to uphold. I humbly believe that those who do not hold the Six Arts in their studies and are not followers of Confucius have lost their paths. They should not be allowed to progress alongside one another; crooked and erroneous doctrines must be eliminated before unity can be achieved, and the laws can be clarified, so that the people know where to follow. Zhongshu replied to the proposal and was appointed as the Governor of Jiangdu. At that time, King Yi of the Han was extraordinarily arrogant and fond of bravery. He asked Zhongshu: 'The King of Yue conspired with the minister Zixiang and the merchant Fan Li to attack Wu and thus destroyed it. Confucius spoke of Yin having three heroes. I also regard Yue as having three heroes.' Zhongshu replied: 'In the past, the Duke of Lu invaded Qi and asked Liu Xiang about it: 'What of my invasion of Qi?' The reply was: 'It cannot be.' When he returned, he had a look of concern and said: 'I have heard that those who invade states should not consult the benevolent; why do I ask this?' This was merely to display the question, and he was still ashamed of it. How much more so if they were to feign deception and invade Wu? Therefore, by this reasoning, Yue has indeed not possessed benevolence.' A benevolent person correctly rectifies what is right and does not seek their own advantage, clarifying their path while not calculating their achievements. This is why, at Confucius' door, even a five-foot child would be ashamed to be compared to the Five Lords, as their predecessors feigned strength before genuinely practicing benevolence and righteousness. The king said: 'Well said.' As for his departure from office to return home, he inquired not at all about family wealth or estate, but rather dedicated himself to studying and writing. He authored a total of over one hundred and thirty volumes, and discussed the matters of the Spring and Autumn Annals in several dozen more. The court held great discussions, and messengers approached his home to question him. The principles of the state were often expounded by Zhongshu. In the second month of spring, on the day of Bing Chen, there was a solar eclipse. General Li Guang was stationed at Yun Zhong, while General Cheng Buzhi was stationed at Yanmen to prepare against the Xiongnu. In June, they were dismissed. Guang and Longxi were both from Longxi and as generals gained the hearts of the soldiers. There were no troop lines or formations; each was allowed to arrange their own rest around water and grass, with each managing themselves, fighting only for defense. The office of the general had little writing, while Cheng Buzhi strictly followed the divisions and formations. They fought only for self-defense.

21,嚴朱吾丘主父徐嚴終王賈傳下,,人臣亦然。昔賢者之未遭遇也，圖事揆策則君不用其謀，陳見悃誠則上不然其信，進仕不得施效，斥逐又非其愆。是故伊尹勤於鼎俎，太公困於鼓刀，百里自鬻，甯子飯牛，離此患也。及其遇明君遭聖主也，運籌合上意，諫諍即見聽，進退得關其忠，任職得行其術，去卑辱奧渫而升本朝，離疏釋蹻而享膏粱，剖符錫壤而光祖考，傳之子孫，以資說士。故世必有聖知之君，而後有賢明之臣。故虎嘯而冽風，龍興而致雲，蟋蟀俟秋吟，蜉蝤出以陰。《易》曰：「飛龍在天，利見大人。」《詩》曰：「思皇多士，生此王國。」故世平主聖，俊艾將自至，若堯、舜、禹、湯、文、武之君，獲稷、契、皋陶、伊尹、呂望，明明在朝，穆穆列布，聚精會神，相得益章。雖伯牙操遞鍾，逢門子彎烏號，猶未足以喻其意也。,"The same applies to the ministers. In ancient times, when the sages had not yet encountered their fates, they devised plans and strategies, yet the rulers did not employ their counsel; they expressed their sincere views, but the sovereign did not trust them; they advanced to serve but could not exert their abilities, and when dismissed, it was not their fault. Therefore, Yi Yin labored over cauldrons and trays, and Duke Zhou struggled with drums and knives, while Bai Li sold himself, and Ning Zi fed the ox, all to distance themselves from these troubles. When they encountered wise rulers and holy lords, they skillfully aligned their strategies with the ruler's intentions; when they offered counsel, they were heard; in their ascents and descents, their loyalty was recognized; in their appointments, they could apply their skills; they departed from humiliation and obscurity and ascended to high positions; they released themselves from neglect and enjoyed rich food; they carved seal and conferred land, thereby bringing glory to their ancestors and passing it on to their descendants, thus benefiting the scholars. Therefore, in the world, there must be rulers with wisdom, and only then can there be ministers of virtue. Thus, when the tiger roars, the chilling wind follows; when the dragon rises, it brings the clouds; the cricket waits to sing in autumn, and the mayfly emerges with the shadows. The Book of Changes states: 'The flying dragon is in the sky; it is beneficial to meet with great men.' The Book of Songs says: 'Thinking of the emperor, many scholars arise in this kingdom.' Therefore, when the world is governed by a sage ruler, outstanding talents will naturally emerge, like the rulers Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu, who were followed by Ji, Xie, Gao Yao, Yi Yin, and Lu Wang, all clearly present in a dignified assembly, focusing their minds and mutually benefiting one another. Even if Bo Ya played his music to infuse the room with the sound of the bell, and if Feng Menzi bent the wren to call, it would still not suffice to convey their intentions.",https://ctext.org/han-shu/yan-zhu-wu-qiu-zhu-fu2,嚴朱吾丘主父徐嚴終王賈傳下,,han-shu,漢書,Han Shu,['Eastern Han'],36.0,111,

The number of prisoners, whether new or old, did not decrease by more than a hundred despite the transitions. The magistrates dispatched by the government reported over a thousand cases to the Minister of Justice in a single year. The major cases often involved evidence and numerous accusations, sometimes affecting hundreds, while minor cases involved dozens of people; the distances spanned thousands of miles for some, and hundreds for others. As cases piled up, officials were held accountable according to the accusations, and those who resisted faced punishment, leading to an environment where accusations were rampant and everyone feared arrest. Long-standing cases sometimes stretched over ten years as people sought to inform one another, and the Great Dī were universally criticized as being unjust. As a result, the Minister of Justice and the officials in the central government had overseen the arrest of up to sixty to seventy thousand individuals, with officials having added more than one hundred thousand in total.",https://ctext.org/han-shu/du-zhou-zhuan,杜周傳,,han-shu,漢書,Han Shu,['Eastern Han'],36.0,111,

Today’s signs are not necessarily the same as those of antiquity, and ancient signs do not necessarily align with today’s. What is obtained and how it is to be interpreted may not correspond. How can this be elucidated? It is due to the differing mandates and fortunes of rising emperors. In the Zhou dynasty, it was indicated by crows and fish, while in the Han dynasty, it was marked by the slaying of great serpents. If we extrapolate to the Tang and Yu dynasties, they were similar to the Zhou and Han.

Following heaven yields less effort but established achievements; aligning with people allows for reduced penalties and effective governance; clarifying rewards and punishments prevents disorder like that of Bo Yi and Dao Zhi.

Ministers of the state should strive for accomplishments in the country to assume their positions, recognize ability in officials to receive their posts, and put forth efforts in balancing power to undertake tasks. All subordinate officials should fulfill their abilities, excel in their offices, and take lightly their responsibilities, without harboring additional strength in their hearts, nor neglecting their duties to the ruler. Thus, within, there will be no hidden resentment leading to chaos; without, there will be no threat from the forces of cavalry. A wise ruler ensures that tasks are unrelated, hence there are no disputes; ensures that soldiers do not hold multiple positions, thus their skills become specialized; allows individuals to have different accomplishments, therefore there is no competition.

28,郊祀志下,,成帝初即位，丞相衡、御史大夫譚奏言：「帝王之事莫大乎承天之序，承天之序莫重於郊祀，故聖王盡心極慮以建其制。祭天於南郊，就陽之義也；瘞地於北郊，即陰之象也。天之於天子也，因其所都而各饗焉。往者，孝武皇帝居甘泉宮，即於雲陽立泰畤，祭於宮南。今行常幸長安，郊見皇天反北之泰陰，祠后土反東之少陽，事與古制殊。又至雲陽，行谿谷中，阨陝且百里，汾陰則渡大川，有風波舟楫之危，皆非聖主所宜數乘。郡縣治道共張，吏民困苦，百官煩費。勞所保之民，行危險之地，難以奉神靈而祈福祐，殆未合於承天子民之意。昔者周文武郊於豐鄗，成王郊於雒邑。由此觀之，天隨王者所居而饗之，可見也。甘泉泰畤、河東后土之祠宜可徙置長安，合於古帝王。願與群臣議定。」奏可。大司馬車騎將軍許嘉等八人以為所從來久遠，宜如故。右將軍王商、博士師丹、議郎翟方進等五十人以為禮記曰「燔柴於太壇，祭天也；瘞薶於大折，祭地也。」兆於南郊，所以定天位也。祭地於大折，在北郊，就陰位也。郊處各在聖王所都之南北。書曰「越三日丁巳，用牲於郊，牛二。」周公加牲，告徙新邑，定郊禮於雒。明王聖主，事天明，事地察。天地明察，神明章矣。天地以王者為主，故聖王制祭天地之禮必於國郊。長安，聖主之居，皇天所觀視也。甘泉、河東之祠非神靈所饗，宜徙就正陽大陰之處。違俗復古，循聖制，定天位，如禮便。於是衡、譚奏議曰：「陛下聖德，璴明上通，承天之大，典覽群下，使各悉心盡慮，議郊祀之處，天下幸甚。臣聞廣謀從眾，則合於天心，故洪範曰『三人占，則從二人言』，言少從多之義也。論當往古，宜於萬民，則依而從之；違道寡與，則廢而不行。今議者五十八人，其五十人言當徙之義，皆著於經傳，同於上世，便於吏民；八人不案經藝，考古制，而以為不宜，無法之議，難以定吉凶。太誓曰：『正稽古立功立事，可以永年，丕天之大律。』《詩》曰『毋曰高高在上，陟降厥士，日監在茲』，言天之日監王者之處也。又曰『乃眷西顧，此維予宅』，言天以文王之都為居也。宜於長安定南北郊，為萬世基。」天子從之。,"At the beginning of Emperor Cheng's reign, the Chancellor Heng and the Minister of Justice Tan reported, saying: 'The greatest affair of the sovereign is to adhere to the heavenly order, and the most important aspect of the heavenly order is the sacrifices at the altars. Therefore, the wise kings exerted their utmost efforts to establish their system. The sacrifice to heaven at the southern altar aligns with the principle of yang; the burial in the northern altar represents the symbolism of yin. Heaven, in relation to the Son of Heaven, is to be honored according to where they reside and to each receive offerings accordingly. In the past, the filial and mighty Emperor Wu resided in the Ganquan Palace, and at Yunyang he established the Great Altar, conducting sacrifices south of the palace. Now, when entering the capital Chang'an, the sacrifices have moved to the heavenly gods before the northern source, the Great Yin, and the earth god facing the east, the Lesser Yang, which deviates from the ancient rites. Furthermore, as we proceed to Yunyang, we traverse through narrow valleys, difficult passes, and a hundred miles distance; the crossing of the great river evokes the danger of winds and waves, which ought not be the norm for a sage lord. With the governance of the commanderies and counties disturbed, both officials and common folk suffer hardship. The laborer who protects the people risks traversing perilous places, making it difficult to worship the divine and seek blessings—this is hardly in line with the intentions of the Son of Heaven for the people. In ancient times, Duke Wen and Duke Wu paid sacrifices at Fenghao, and King Cheng at Luoyi. From this, we can observe that heaven follows where the king resides to offer sacrifices. The Ganquan Great Altar and the altar dedicated to the earth in Hedong ought to be established in Chang'an, complying with the customs of the ancient emperors. We hope to discuss this with all ministers.' The proposal was approved. However, the Grand Marshal Cheqi General Xu Jia and seven others argued that since these practices have long been in place, they should remain as they are. The Right General Wang Shang, Doctor Shi Dan, Councilor Zhai Fangjin, and fifty others opined that the Book of Rites states: 'Burning wood at the Great Altar is a sacrifice to heaven; burying herbs at the Great Fold is a sacrifice to the earth.' The sacrifices at the southern altar are designed to establish heaven's position. Sacrificing to the earth at the Great Fold, located in the northern altar, aligns with the principles of yin. The locations for sacrifices are based on where the sage kings resided in the south and north. The records state: 'After three days, on Ding Si, offerings of two cattle are to be made at the altar.' Duke Zhou increased the offerings and announced the relocation to the new capital, establishing the rules for sacrifices in Luoyi. The wise king and sage lord clearly recognize the divine rites for heaven and earth. Heaven and earth scrutinize matters, thus manifesting divine principles. Since heaven and earth see the ruler as principal, the sage kings must establish the sacrificial rites for heaven and earth within the national borders. Chang'an is the residence of the sage lord, and heaven observes here. The altars in Ganquan and Hedong ought not to be where the divine is worshipped; they should be moved to a designated place of yang and yin. Deviating from custom and reverting to the ancient practices, adhering to the solemn regulations, and establishing the position of heaven, all this is appropriate according to the rites. Subsequently, Heng and Tan reported, saying: 'Your Majesty’s virtuous wisdom illuminates above and connects to heaven’s vastness, overseeing all below, allowing everyone to thoroughly consider and deliberate on the site for sacrifices, a great fortune for the realm. I have heard that broad deliberation leads to unison with heavenly sentiments, hence it is stated in the Hong Fan: 'When three people deliberate, the words of the two should be followed,' indicating the importance of the majority. Thus, when reflecting on the ancient, choices should consider the masses, leading to adherence or deviation accordingly. Now, among the fifty-eight deliberators, fifty propose to relocate, all based on the scriptures and traditions from previous generations, favorable for both officials and common folk; eight, however, have not consulted the texts nor examined the ancient rites, asserting it is inappropriate, their arguments lacking in legal basis and hard to determine auspicious or inauspicious outcomes. The Great Oaths state: 'Establishing meritorious deeds and causes in accordance with ancient standards can endure across ages, following heaven's great laws.' The Book of Poetry says: 'Do not assert that the heights are lofty; the day supervises here,' denoting how heaven observes the place of the ruler. Furthermore, it says: 'Thus I glance to the west, this is my residence,' indicating that heaven regards the capital of King Wen. Thus, it is appropriate to establish the southern and northern altars in Chang'an, as a foundation for generations to come.' The Son of Heaven acquiesced to this.",https://ctext.org/han-shu/jiao-si-zhi-xia,郊祀志下,,han-shu,漢書,Han Shu,['Eastern Han'],36.0,111,

Yet now it is different; many think of the distant and forget the near, turn their backs on the old and turn towards the new. Some grow distant over the years, while others abandon one another midway, disregarding the admonitions of the ancient sages and breaking the promises made long ago. What is the reason for this? Upon reflection, it is also understandable. There are constant tendencies in power, and certain truths remain firm. When it comes to wealth and nobility, people tend to flock toward it; this is a constant tendency of power.

The Wu and Jin clashed over precedence. The Wu people said, 'In the Zhou realm, I am the elder.' The Jin people replied, 'Among the Ji lineage, I am the elder.' Zhao Yang called for Sima Yin, saying, 'The day is late, and the important matters are not settled, this is the fault of the two ministers. Let us sound the drum and arrange the seats, and the deaths of the two ministers will surely clarify the ranks of elder and younger.' The reply was, 'Let us consider this for now.' The response was, 'Those who eat meat have no ink. Now the King of Wu has ink, and the country prevails. If the eldest son dies, and Yi De is light, it cannot be tolerated for long, so let us wait a little.' Thus the Jin were prioritized. The Wu would present formally to the Jin marquis. Zifu Jingbo responded to the messenger, saying, 'When the king gathers the lords, the marquis leads the lords and the shepherds to meet the king. When the marquis gathers the lords, then the lords lead the sons to meet the marquis. Below the king, the morning audience and tributes vary, thus our city contributes to Wu, has abundance with Jin, and is not lacking, treating it as a marquis. Now the lords gather, but Your Majesty will see the Jin lord with few peers; then Jin would become the marquis. Our city would change its tribute demands, Lu pays to Wu eight hundred chariots, if treated as a son, then will send half of Zhu to belong to Wu, and apply to Zhu for matters with Jin. Moreover, engaging the marquis to summon the lords and ending with the lords, what benefit is there? The Wu people then ceased. Soon after regretting it, they planned to imprison Jingbo. Jingbo said, 'What is this? There will be a successor for Lu. There will be two chariots, accompanied by six men, to move at your command.' Thus he returned after being imprisoned. When reaching the doors and window, he told the Grand Minister, 'Lu will present offerings on the upper day of the tenth month to the Supreme Emperor and the previous kings, to complete it on the season of Jixin. Why? There has always been an official role in place since Xiang. If we do not gather, the ancestral offerings will state that Wu is indeed so, and furthermore, if they claim that Lu does not cooperate, by holding the seven lowest, what harm is there? The Grand Minister, Yan, spoke with the king, saying, 'It does not harm Lu and is merely for appearance; it is better to return him.' Thus, Jingbo was returned. Wu's Shen Shuyi pleaded for provisions from Gongsun Youshan, saying, 'With jade pendants in hand, I have nothing to bind them with. A fine wine served, I compare myself with the father of He.' The response was, 'There is none in Liang, yet coarseness exists. If one climbs Mt. Shou and calls out 'Geng Gui?', then yes.' The king wished to attack Song, killing its men and capturing its women. The Grand Minister, Yan, said, 'It can be defeated, but it cannot be held; thus, he returned.

The mismanagement of governance harmed the population, causing illness and shortening lives. After suffering under the violent Qin regime, they thus fell into forgetfulness. During the rise of the Han, the family of Zhi took charge of great music, being somewhat capable of recording its rhythmic sounds, yet unable to explain its meaning.

0,復恩,,孔子曰：「德不孤，必有鄰。」夫施德者貴不德，受恩者尚必報；是故臣勞勤以為君而不求其賞，君持施以牧下而無所德，故《易》曰：「勞而不怨，有功而不德，厚之至也。」君臣相與以市道接，君縣祿以待之，臣竭力以報之；逮臣有不測之功，則主加之以重賞，如主有超異之恩，則臣必死以復之。孔子曰：北方有獸，其名曰蟨，前足鼠，後足兔，是獸也，甚矣其愛蛩蛩巨虛也，食得甘草，必齧以遺蛩蛩巨虛，蛩蛩巨虛見人將來，必負蟨以走，蟨非性之愛蛩蛩巨虛也，為其假足之故也，二獸者亦非性之愛蟨也，為其得甘草而遺之故也。夫禽獸昆蟲猶知比假而相有報也，況於士君子之欲與名利於天下者乎！夫臣不復君之恩而苟營其私門，禍之源也；君不能報臣之功而憚刑賞者，亦亂之基也。夫禍亂之原基，由不報恩生矣。,"Confucius said: ""Virtue does not stand alone; it will always have neighbors."" Those who bestow virtue hold it in high regard and those who receive kindness still must repay it; therefore, ministers toil diligently for their lords without seeking reward, while lords provide for the people without actively demonstrating virtue. The Book of Changes states: ""To labor without complaint, to achieve merit without recognition, this is the pinnacle of benevolence."" Lords and ministers engage in the market way of exchange: the lord grants salaries to await their service, and ministers exert their utmost to repay them. When a minister unexpectedly achieves merit, the ruler rewards him with heavy accolades; conversely, when the ruler extends extraordinary kindness, the minister must repay with his life. Confucius said: In the north, there is a beast called the 'Jue,' which has the front feet of a rat and the hind feet of a rabbit. This beast is indeed greatly loving towards the large and empty 'QiongQiong,' and when it finds sweet grass, it will surely nibble on it and leave it behind for 'QiongQiong.' When 'QiongQiong' sees someone approaching, it will bear the 'Jue' and flee; the 'Jue' does not inherently love 'QiongQiong,' but due to its borrowed limbs. Likewise, the two beasts do not inherently love the 'Jue,' but because they acquire the sweet grass and leave it behind. Even birds, beasts, and insects know how to reciprocate when they borrow; how much more should the noble scholars desire reputation and gain in the world! When a minister does not repay the lord's kindness and consents to run his own selfish interests, it becomes the source of disaster; when a lord cannot repay a minister's merit and fears punishment and reward, it also becomes the foundation of chaos. Thus, the origin of calamity and disorder arises from unreciprocated kindness.",https://ctext.org/shuo-yuan/fu-en,復恩,,shuo-yuan,說苑,Shuo Yuan,['Western Han'],-206.0,9,

Yan Nian removed his cap and bowed at the threshold for a long time, and only then did his mother see him.

You resort to harsh punishments and execute people to establish your authority—how can that be the intention of a parent to the people!'

Those he favored had the law twisted to spare them, while those he despised faced the law's harshest penalties. In the commandery he governed, he would certainly eliminate the nobility. When serving as a governor, he regarded the district commanders as mere orders; when he was a commander, he overstepped his authority and deprived the governors of their power. Ji An was consumed by resentment; Sima Anzhi was hated in literature. They were all within the ranks of 2,000 stone but never dared to share a seat with him. Later, Yangyou became the commander of Hedong and competed for power with the governor Sheng Tugu. They confided in each other, and Sheng Tugu was to be punished; when he proposed to resist punishment and committed suicide, Yangyou was executed publicly.",https://ctext.org/han-shu/ku-li-zhuan,酷吏傳,,han-shu,漢書,Han Shu,['Eastern Han'],36.0,111,

5,第五,,元光元年七月，京師雨雹。鮑敞問董仲舒曰：「雹何物也？何氣而生之？」仲舒曰：「陰氣脅陽氣。天地之氣，陰陽相半，和氣周迴，朝夕不息。陽德用事，則和氣皆陽，建巳之月是也，故謂之正陽之月。陰德用事，則和氣皆陰，建亥之月是也，故謂之正陰之月。十月陰雖用事，而陰不孤立，此月純陰，疑於無陽，故謂之陽月，詩人所謂『日月陽止』者也。四月陽雖用事，而陽不獨存，此月純陽，疑於無陰，故亦謂之陰月。自十月已後，陽氣始生於地下，漸冉流散，故言息也，陰氣轉收，故言消也。日夜滋生，遂至四月，純陽用事。自四月已後，陰氣始生於天上，漸冉流散，故言息也。陽氣轉收，故言消也。日夜滋生，遂至十月，純陰用事。二月、八月，陰陽正等，無多少也。以此推移，無有差慝。運動抑揚，更相動薄，則熏蒿歊蒸，而風雨雲霧，雷電雪雹生焉。氣上薄為雨，下薄為霧，風其噫也，雲其氣也，雷其相擊之聲也，電其相擊之光也。二氣之初蒸也，若有若無，若實若虛，若方若圓。攢聚相合，其體稍重，故雨乘虛而墜。風多則合速，故雨大而踈。風少則合遲，故雨細而密。其寒月則雨凝於上，體尚輕微，而因風相襲，故成雪焉。寒有高下，上暖下寒，則上合為大雨，下凝為冰霰雪是也。雹，霰之流也，陰氣暴上，雨則凝結成雹焉。太平之世，則風不鳴條，開甲散萌而已；雨不破塊，潤葉津莖而已；雷不驚人，號令啟發而已；電不眩目，宣示光耀而已；霧不寒望，浸淫被泊而已；雪不封條，凌殄毒害而已。雲則五色而為慶，三色而成矞；露則結味而成甘，結潤而成膏。此聖人之在上，則陰陽和，風雨時也。政多紕繆，則陰陽不調。風發屋，雨溢河，雪至牛目，雹殺驢馬，此皆陰陽相蕩，而為祲沴之妖也。」敞曰：「四月無陰，十月無陽，何以明陰不孤立，陽不獨存邪？」仲舒曰：「陰陽雖異，而所資一氣也。陽用事，此則氣為陽；陰用事，此則氣為陰。陰陽之時雖異，而二體常存。猶如一鼎之水，而未加火，純陰也；加火極熱，純陽也。純陽則無陰，息火水寒，則更陰矣；純陰則無陽，加火水熱，則更陽矣。然則建巳之月為純陽，不容都無復陰也，但是陽家用事，陽氣之極耳。薺夌枯，由陰殺也。建亥之月為純陰，不容都無復陽也，但是陰家用事，陰氣之極耳。薺麥始生，由陽升也。其著者，葶藶死於盛夏，款冬華於嚴寒，水極陰而有溫泉，火至陽而有涼焰。故知陰不得無陽，陽不容都無陰也。」敞曰：「冬雨必暖，夏雨必涼，何也？」曰：「冬氣多寒，陽氣自上躋，故人得其暖，而上蒸成雪矣。夏氣多暖，陰氣自下昇，故人得其涼，而上蒸成雨矣。」敞曰：「雨既陰陽相蒸，四月純陽，十月純陰，斯則無二氣相薄，則不雨乎？」曰：「然則純陽純陰，雖在四月十月，但月中之一日耳。」敞曰：「月中何日？」曰：「純陽用事，未夏至一日；純陰用事，未冬至一日。朔旦、夏至、冬至，其正氣也。」敞曰：「然則未至一日，其不雨乎？」曰：「然。頗有之，則妖也。和氣之中，自生災沴，能使陰陽改節，暖涼失度。」敞曰：「災沴之氣，其常存邪？」曰：「無也，時生耳。猶乎人四支五臟，中也有時，及其病也，四支五臟皆病也。」敞遷延負牆，俛揖而退。,"In the first year of Yuan Guang, in the seventh month, there was rain and hail in the capital. Bao Chang asked Dong Zhongshu, 'What is hail? What kind of qi produces it?' Zhongshu replied, 'Yin qi presses on yang qi. The qi of heaven and earth, in which yin and yang are balanced, circulates harmoniously, day and night without cease. When yang virtue is active, the harmonious qi is all yang; this is the month of Ji Si, hence it is called the month of proper yang. When yin virtue is active, the harmonious qi is all yin; this is the month of Ji Hai, hence it is called the month of proper yin. In October, though yin is active, it does not exist in isolation; this month is pure yin, as though there were no yang, so it is called the month of yang, as the poet says, 'the sun and moon stop at yang.' In April, though yang is active, it does not exist solely; this month is pure yang, as though there were no yin, so it is also called the month of yin. From October onwards, yang qi begins to emerge from the earth, gradually dispersing, hence it is said to cease; yin qi reverses to collect, hence it is said to diminish. Day and night, they nourish each other, leading up to April, where pure yang is active. From April onwards, yin qi begins to emerge from the sky, gradually dispersing, hence it is said to cease; yang qi reverses to gather, hence it is said to diminish. Day and night, they nourish each other, leading up to October, where pure yin is active. In February and August, yin and yang are equal, without excess or deficiency. By this measure, there should not be discrepancies. Movement and stillness correspond with each other, thus the vapors swirl and steam, producing wind, rain, clouds, mist, thunder, and hail. Qi thins out above to form rain and below to form mist; wind is its breath, clouds are its qi, thunder is the sound of collision, and lightning is the light of collision. The initial steaming of the two energies is elusive, as if there yet were or were not, as if solid or void, as if square or round. When gathered together and combined, their substance becomes slightly heavy, hence rain falls into the void. When there is much wind, gathering is quick, hence the rain is heavy and sparse. When there is little wind, gathering is slow, hence the rain is fine and dense. In the cold months, if rain凝s above, its substance remains light and delicate; when the wind carries it, it becomes snow. When there is cold with variation in elevation, warmth above and cold below, this causes great rain above to gather and ice, hail, or snow below. Hail is formed from the flow of sleet; when yin qi violently rises, rain condenses into hail. In a peaceful era, wind does not rustle canopies; it merely opens and scatters buds; rain does not shatter blocks; it only moistens leaves and stems; thunder does not startle people; it merely issues commands and enlightens; lightning does not dazzle; it merely illuminates; mist does not chill expectations; it simply soaks and saturates; snow does not seal canopies; it merely destroys and causes harm. Clouds are five colors as a celebration and three colors as a manifestation; dew forms flavor and becomes sweet, condensing moisture to become balm. When the sage is above, yin and yang are harmonious, and wind and rain come in their time. If administration is full of mistakes, then yin and yang do not align. Wind shakes houses, rain floods rivers, snow reaches the eyes of cattle, hail kills donkeys and horses; all these arise from the fluctuations of yin and yang, causing calamities as their manifestations.' Chang said, 'What about April with no yin or October with no yang? How can you clarify that yin does not exist in isolation and yang does not exist alone?' Zhongshu replied, 'Though yin and yang are different, they rely on the same qi. When yang is active, it is thus qi becomes yang; when yin is active, it is thus qi becomes yin. Although in time they are different, the two bodies always exist. It is like a cauldron of water that has not yet been heated, pure yin; when heat is added, it becomes extremely hot, pure yang. Pure yang does not contain yin; when the heat of fire wanes, the water grows cold, becoming more yin; pure yin does not contain yang; when heat is added, the water warms, becoming more yang. Thus, the month of Ji Si represents pure yang, and there cannot be any restoration of yin; it is merely that yang virtue is in action, and this is the utmost of yang qi. The reeds wither because yin has killed them. The month of Ji Hai is pure yin, and there cannot be any restoration of yang; it is merely that yin virtue is in action, and this is the utmost of yin qi. The wild vegetables begin to grow because yang has ascended. What is evident, the plants die in the midst of summer, and blossom in the harsh winter; water is extremely yin yet has hot springs, and fire is extremely yang yet has cool flame. Hence, we know yin cannot exist without yang, and yang cannot exist without yin.' Chang said, 'Rain in winter must be warm, and rain in summer must be cool; why is this?' Zhongshu replied, 'Winter's cold qi is abundant, while yang qi ascends from above, hence humans feel warmth, and it becomes snow through the rising vapor. Summer's warm qi is abundant, while yin qi rises from below, hence humans feel cool, and it becomes rain through the rising vapor.' Chang said, 'If rain is indeed from the steaming of yin and yang, and April is pure yang while October is pure yin, then without the two energies interacting, how could there be rain?' Zhongshu said, 'Thus, pure yang and pure yin, though in April and October, are merely one day within the month.' Chang said, 'What day within the month?' Zhongshu said, 'When pure yang is active, it is the day before summer solstice; when pure yin is active, it is the day before winter solstice. The day before the new moon, summer solstice, winter solstice, these are the correct energies.' Chang said, 'If it is the day before the solstice, will there be no rain?' Zhongshu said, 'Yes. Occasionally there may be calamitous phenomena, but it is rare. Within the harmonizing qi, disasters and calamities arise, able to cause changes in the seasons of yin and yang, causing warm and cool to lose their proper balance.' Chang said, 'Is the qi of calamity and disaster always present?' Zhongshu said, 'No, it arises at specific times. Just as in one's limbs and organs, there is a balance, and when sickness arises, they all become ill.' Chang then backed away, humbly bowing and retreating.",https://ctext.org/xijing-zaji/5,第五,,xijing-zaji,西京雜記,Xijing Zaji,['Western Zhou'],-1046.0,-771,

He dispatched Dāng Hóu, Panzi, Sīmǎ Dù, Xiāo Yǐn, Wǔlíng, and Yǐn Xǐ to lead an army to besiege Xu, in order to intimidate Wu. The Duke of Chu camped at Qianxi to provide support; it rained and snowed. The king donned the royal cap from Qin, adorned himself with a green cloak and leopard-patterned shoes, and holding the whip set out. The servants and father of Xi were with him. On the evening of the right minister Zige, the king saw this, removed his cap, laid aside the whip, and spoke to him saying: 'In times past, my ancestor King Xiong Yi, along with Lü Ji, Wang Sun Mu, Xie Fu, and Qin Fu served King Kang. Each of the four states received their share, yet I alone possess nothing. Now I send someone to Zhou, to seek a cauldron as my share, will you grant it to me?' The king replied, 'To you, my lord?In times past, my ancestor King Xiong Yi, after establishing himself in Jing Shan, traveled rough roads, toilfully traversing mountains and forests to serve the Son of Heaven. The only matters he dealt with were the peach bows and thorn arrows, to jointly defend the royal interests. The king of Qi is the maternal uncle, while Jin and Lu both serve as subjects. Hence, Chu has no share, while they all possess one. Now Zhou and the four states are in service to the kings, and will completely follow commands—would they care for the cauldron?' The king said, 'In times past, my Imperial Ancestor Bo Fu Kun Wu was originally granted this dwelling. Now the people of Zheng greedily claim their land and will not share with me. If I seek this, will you grant it to me?' The reply was, 'To you, my lord?' Zhou does not cherish cauldrons; Zheng dares to cherish their land. The king said, 'In times past, the feudal lords feared me and distanced themselves from Jin. Now with my great cities, Chen and Cai do not offer me piglets, and their tributes number a thousand carts; do you labor for me?' The reply was, 'They truly fear you, my lord. The four states primarily fear you; with the addition of Chu, who would dare not fear you?' Minister Gōng Yǐn Lù requested, 'My lord commands to peel the jade to make a carving stick; may I boldly request this command?' The king entered to check on it. The father of Xi told Zige, 'My son, you are the hope of the state of Chu; now speaking with the king is like an echo; how will the state be?' Zige said, 'Sharpen and prepare.' The king left; my blade is about to strike. The king returned and conversed again; the left historian leaned forward as he passed. The king said, 'This is a fine historian; you should observe him well. He can read the Three Canons and the Five Classics, the Eight Searches and the Nine Mounds.' The reply was, 'I once inquired about this: in ancient times, King Mu sought to expand his heart, his travels across Zhou drew the imprint of chariot wheels and horse tracks; Minister Ji of Gao worked with Fu to compose the Prayer Inviting Poem, to calm the king's heart; thus it was that he could see things in the Palace of the Ancestors. I inquired about the poem but did not know it; what if I asked it from afar, how could it possibly be known?' The king said, 'Can you do it?' The reply was, 'I can. The poem goes: 'Inviting prayer appears solemn; it clearly magnifies virtue; think of my king's measure, as jade, as gold, shaping the people's strength, and possessing a heart that is neither drunken nor sated.' The king made a bow and entered, feasting without eating, sleeping without rest; for several days he could not control himself, while encountering difficulties.

If he were to imitate antiquity, he would be behind the times; and if he follows the present time, he is obstructed by circumstances. The Zhou dynasty did not imitate the Shang dynasty, nor did the Xia dynasty imitate the period of Yu; the three dynasties encountered different circumstances, but all three succeeded in attaining supremacy. So to rise to supremacy, there is a definite way, but to hold it there are different principles. For example, Wu as a rebel seized the empire, and yet he prized obedience to the law; he disputed the empire, and yet exalted compliancy; by force he seized it, but by righteousness he held it. Nowadays strong countries aim at annexation, while weak countries are concerned for defence by force, which means that compared with early times they are not equal to the times of Yu and Xia, and compared with later times they do not practise the principles of Tang and Wu. Because the principles of Tang and Wu are obstructed, of the countries of ten thousand chariots there is not one that does not wage war, and of the countries of a thousand chariots there is not one that is not on the defence. These principles (of Tang and Wu) have been obstructed a long time, and none of the rulers of the world is able to develop them. Therefore, there is not a fourth added to the three dynasties, and unless there be an intelligent ruler, there is none who succeeds in being obeyed. Now you want to develop the people by imitating the ancient rulers, but the people of old were simple through honesty, while the people of today are clever through artificiality.",https://ctext.org/shang-jun-shu/opening-and-debarring,開塞,Opening and Debarring,shang-jun-shu,商君書,Shang Jun Shu,['Warring States'],-475.0,-221,True

The five stars rise at their beginning, and the sun and moon arise among them, totaling twelve cycles. When the sun reaches its beginning, it marks a festival; when it reaches the middle, the Dipper establishes the twelve zodiacs. By observing its establishment, one knows the next period. Hence it is said, 'To establish rites above the matter, it does not exceed twelve; this is the great number of heaven.' The classics say spring kings in the first month, and the tradition says Zhou in the first month, 'Fire emerges in summer as the third month, in Shang as the fourth month, and in Zhou as the fifth month. The summer number attains heaven,' thus obtaining the right of the four seasons. The three dynasties each held unity, understanding that the three unities are constantly combined, and alternated to become the head, ascending and descending as the head of the three unities, Zhou returns to the way of the five elements. Thus, three and five are intertwined and give birth. The correctness of the heavenly unity begins at the first half of the child, where the sun germinates with a red color. The earthly unity receives this at the beginning of the ox, where the sun initiates transformation and turns yellow; by the half of the ox, the sun transforms into white. The human unity receives this at the beginning of the tiger, where the sun tempts creation and turns black; by the half of the tiger, the sun generates and turns green. Heaven applies it again at the child; the earth's transformation from the ox completes by the dragon; the human life from the tiger takes shape by the monkey. Thus, the calendar numbers of the three unities: heaven with Jiazi, earth with Jiachen, people with Jiashen. Meng, Zhong, and Ji successively hold office as the head of the unity. Once the three subtle unities are established, the five elements begin from green, and their sequence is also like this. The five elements and the three unities intertwine. The tradition says 'Heaven has three zodiacs, and the earth has five elements,' thus the three unities and the five stars can be understood. The 'Yi' states: 'Combine the five for transformation, intricately weaving their numbers. Through their transformations, the literature of the world is achieved; by limiting their numbers, the images of the world are determined.' The Taiji operates the three zodiacs and five stars above. The primal qi transforms the three unities and five elements below. For humans, the royal extremity unites the three virtues and five matters. Thus, the combination of the three zodiacs in the three unities: the sun combines with the heavenly unity, the moon combines with the earthly unity, and the Dipper combines with the human unity. The combination of the five stars in the five elements: water combines with the zodiac of the dragon, fire combines with the blazing star, metal combines with the white star, wood combines with the year's star, and earth combines with the filling star. The three zodiacs and five stars weave together. Heaven produces water with one, earth produces fire with two, heaven produces wood with three, earth produces metal with four, and heaven produces earth with five. The five victories multiply to give birth to the minor Zhou, multiplying the strategies of the universe, thus forming the greater Zhou. Yin and yang compare and correspond, interweaving to form, thus the transformations of nine and six ascend and descend within six bodies. The three subtle unities are established, the three established form images, two images undergo eighteen transformations to form hexagrams, and four camps form the 'Yi,' totaling seventy-two, which is the product of the three unities and two four seasons. If three are taken, one attains the strategy of Qian; if two are taken, one attains the strategy of Kun. By the Yang nine times, it results in six hundred forty-eight; by the Yin six times, it results in four hundred thirty-two, totaling one thousand eighty, the subtle calculations of each yin and yang hexagram. By multiplying eight, it results in eight thousand six hundred forty, forming the minor bagua. If extended and believed again, multiplying by eight results in sixty-nine thousand one hundred twenty; heaven and earth twice leads to one hundred thirty-eight thousand two hundred forty, and then the great completion. When the five stars converge at the end, they touch on the classes and grow, multiplying by the years, resulting in two million six hundred twenty-six thousand five hundred sixty, thus joining with the sun and moon. The three gatherings result in seven million eight hundred seventy-nine thousand six hundred eighty, thus joining with the three unities. The three unities yield twenty-three million nine hundred forty thousand, thus returning to the Taiji's upper origin. Nine chapters and six are the method; the Taiji's upper origin is the reality. Reality, like the law, obtains one; yin one and yang each one thousand five hundred twenty, being the number of the gaseous states of all things, thus ends the capabilities of the world.",https://ctext.org/han-shu/lv-li-zhi-shang,律曆志上,,han-shu,漢書,Han Shu,['Eastern Han'],36.0,111,

There are those who desire much and thereby perish, yet there are none who are without desire and face danger; there are those who wish to govern and cause chaos, yet there are none who uphold the eternal and lose. Therefore, wisdom alone cannot avoid calamity, and folly cannot reach a state of peace. To guard one's portion and follow reason, to lose without worry and gain without joy, thus achievements are not what one strives for, and gains are not what one seeks. Those who enter possess without taking, and those who exit bestow without giving; they grow with spring and perish with autumn, what is born is not blessed, what is killed is not resented, this is close to the Dao. The sage does not act in ways that invite criticism, nor does he resent others for failing to be himself; he cultivates the virtue worthy of praise without seeking accolades from others; he cannot prevent disaster from arriving, believing in the inevitability of his own misfortune; he cannot ensure that fortune comes inevitably, believing in the inevitability of not seizing it. The arrival of misfortune does not stem from his desires, thus he remains poor yet untroubled; the arrival of fortune does not arise from his ambitions, thus he remains unobtrusive and free from pride. Knowing that the regulations of misfortune and fortune depend not on oneself, he can dwell in leisure and rule through non-action. The sage safeguards what he possesses and does not seek what he has yet to gain. To seek what one does not have will result in losing what one already possesses; to refine what one has will bring what one desires closer. Therefore, those who engage in warfare first create an indomitable defense, waiting for an opportunity to conquer the enemy; those who govern a nation first create an unassailable foundation, awaiting the enemy's potential for conquest. Shun rectified Mount Li, and the world was transformed; Wen Wang corrected the Qi and Zhou, and the winds of the world shifted.

The beginning is called 'emerging', and the end is called 'entering', hence it is said: 'birth and death'. The human body consists of three hundred sixty joints, limbs, and nine orifices, all of great significance. The movements of the limbs and the nine orifices, which total thirteen, belong entirely to life. Those associated with life are thus referred to as 'the thirteen of life'. When it comes to death, the thirteen components also return to be associated with death, and the components of death also number thirteen, hence it is said: 'The thirteen of life; the thirteen of death.' All people are born and continuing to be alive is a certainty, movement leads to depletion, and perpetual movement results in continuous loss. If loss is unending, then life is exhausted. The exhaustion of life is termed death, thus all thirteen components become as dead corpses. Hence it is proclaimed: 'In human life, living and moving all lead to death, in the thirteen.' Therefore, the sage cherishes the spirit and values stillness greatly, which is far more significant than the harm caused by tigers and rhinoceroses. Tigers and rhinoceroses have territories, and movement and stillness occur at certain times. By avoiding their territories and being frugal with one’s time, one can escape harm from tigers and rhinoceroses. People only understand that tigers and rhinoceroses have claws and horns, yet do not realize that all things each possess their claws and horns, thus cannot escape harm from all things. How can this be deliberated? When rain falls and gathers, the wilderness becomes calm, but at dawn and dusk it trespasses into mountains and rivers, thus exposing one to the harm of winds and dew. Being disloyal to affairs and lightly violating prohibitions will harm one with the claws and horns of laws. In society, failing to moderate emotions of love and hatred leads to the claws and horns of contention harming one. Unrestrained desires, uncontrolled activities, result in harm from the claws and horns of conditions. If one prefers to use personal intelligence while abandoning principles, then one is harmed by the snares of entrapment. Tigers and rhinoceroses have territories, yet countless harms have origins. Avoid their territories and block their origins, then one can be free from all harm. All warfare is a means to prepare for harm. Although a reborn individual enters the army without a heart of resentment or contest, without such a heart, there is no need to prepare for harm. This does not merely refer to military action in remote areas; a sage who traverses the world possesses no intent to harm others, and without such an intent, there will certainly be no harm from others. If there is no harm from others, then one does not prepare against others. Thus it is said: 'One traveling on land does not encounter tigers and rhinoceroses.' Entering the mountains without relying on equipment for protection is why it is said: 'Entering the army without armor and weapons.'

As a result, the Qiang were very angry and conspired to seek revenge, which worried the court. The officials recommended Xu Jin to replace Yu as Protector General. The Qiang, inflamed with anger, joined together to resolve their grievances through marriage, exchanged hostages, and vowed together, numbering over forty thousand people, planning to cross the ice and attack Xu. Previously, the Lesser Yuezhi, led by Hu Fen, dwelt within the passes, with two or three thousand cavalry, all brave and strong, often defeating the Qiang with a smaller force. Although they both engaged in conflicts, the Han sometimes gained from them as well. At that time, Miwu's son Mi Tang, allied with the Qiang of Wuwei to bring ten thousand cavalry to the lower passes, but did not dare to attack Xu; instead, they wanted to threaten the Lesser Yuezhi. Xu, having the guards stationed, ordered that there be no battle. The advisors all reasoned that it would be beneficial for the county officials if the Qiang and Hu fought against each other, urging that it was inappropriate to restrict the protection. Xu replied, 'Not so. Now that Zhang Yu has lost trust, the Qiang are greatly agitated, commonly garrisoning troops numbering no less than twenty thousand. The costs of transporting these forces empty the treasury, and the officials of Liangzhou are burdened with their duties. The reason why the Hu have had difficulty achieving their goals is that they lack respect and trust. Now, due to their urgent situation, let us win them over with virtue, so that they may become useful.' He then ordered the opening of the city gates and the doors of the garden where they resided, and all Qiang wives and children were to be brought inside, with strict military guards in place. The Qiang were unable to seize anything and did not dare to threaten the Hu, and so they retreated. As a result, the Hu in the Huang Zhong region all said, 'The Han family always wants to fight against us, but now Governor Deng regards us with kindness and trust, opening the gates to allow our wives and children inside, thus we can return to our parents.' They all rejoiced and prostrated, saying, 'We follow the commands of the Governor.'

When it came to attire and ornaments, differences in dress and color were not violated. In recent generations, deceit has taken root, with the high and low deceiving each other.

They are all known for their audacity to protect their keen sensitivity, skillfully attached to written regulations, with their winds chilling and frosts severe, their power and reputation deafening. How different are they from the resolute and principled officials who uphold the path! Therefore, we observe that the severe techniques of tyrants like Huang and Ba, and the secret ridicule of policies by people like Zhuo and Mao, though fearsome, have often not triumphed completely. Yet, Zhu Yì does not subject people to punishment and humiliation; Yuan An has never wrongfully judged anyone; thus, the crafty and wicked restrain themselves, and people do not deceive or violate others. What is the reason? It is because when authority is effectively exercised, the actions of the unprincipled surface; but with kindness and trust in virtue, the feelings of those affected are profound.

Ju replied: 'Your Majesty, upon your ascension, adhered to the old regulations, promoted virtue in governance, and both distant and near regions were orderly. In recent years, there have been slight deviations from this; the court has increased favoritism, and rewards do not follow virtue. Observing heaven and examining people, comparing the present with the past, it is indeed a reason for concern. The Book states: ""Usurp the sun’s brightness like the sun itself."" If usurpation is boundless, then words do not align and the lower ranks are not rectified; without the sun's control, the upper disrupts and the lower exhausts. It is advisable to strictly issue decrees to the provinces, scrutinize powerful clans and grave offenses, and prosecute them in a timely manner.'

The sage kings and wise rulers all encountered the difficulties of hardship, suffering the shame of being unrelenting. Bound in body yet esteemed in name, humiliated in form yet revered in sound; they occupy low positions without considering them as evil, dwell in peril without thinking of them as slight. The Five Emperors, despite their profound virtue, experienced the regret of poverty, yet they still had worries about inundation. The three endured the shame of dire straits, not leaving the plight of the three prisons, weeping and suffering injustice, weeping as they became servants, interpreting the I Ching to produce divinations, and the heavenly way granted them aid. When time surpasses expectation, the end of adversity leads to prosperity; the princes unite to assist, and the king’s mandate is seen as a sign, with the red mane and the black fox. The assisting ministers, with their hair unbound, dismantle prisons and break shackles, restore the nation and cultivate virtue, thus avenging their grievances. They rise to prominence across the realm, as effortlessly as flipping a hand, and the world reveres them, their achievements enduring for ten thousand generations. Great King, though you are in a state of misfortune, I sincerely offer counsel; indeed, the sword that cuts through bones does not provide the benefit of sharpness; the iron spear that scoops does not allow for the division of a hair; those who establish strategies do not preach the idea of violence. Now I examine celestial phenomena, inspect shattered records; the dual forces coalesce, life and death in different places. When they rise, I am humiliated; when I dominate, they perish. The two kingdoms contend for the path, yet it is unknown where it leads. The king’s peril is determined by the heavenly order; why must you harm yourself? Indeed, auspiciousness is the doorway to misfortune; blessings are the root of calamity.
